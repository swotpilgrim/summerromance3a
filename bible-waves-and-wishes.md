# BIBLE: Waves and Wishes

## Story Premise

Lily Palmer arrives at Camp Silver Lake expecting to hide behind her books all summer, but life has other plans. When she develops a hopeless crush on golden-boy counselor Michael Grant, she doesn't anticipate that Jamie Sullivan—the camp troublemaker who won't leave her alone—will become the person who truly sees her. As summer unfolds, Lily must learn the difference between a safe fantasy and real connection, discovering that the boy she thought was all wrong might actually be exactly right.

## Protagonist: Lily Palmer

**Age:** 16

**Background:** Lily comes from a middle-class suburban home where her parents' constant fighting has taught her that silence and invisibility are survival skills. She's an only child who learned early to disappear into books rather than deal with the tension at home. Her parents enrolled her in Camp Silver Lake hoping summer camp would "bring her out of her shell," not understanding that her shell is her protection.

**Personality:** Quiet, observant, intelligent, and deeply self-protective. Lily sees herself as fundamentally uninteresting—the kind of girl who fades into the background while prettier, more confident girls capture attention. She's thoughtful and kind but believes she has nothing valuable to offer in social situations. Books are her real friends; fictional characters never disappoint or leave. She has a rich inner life but struggles to let anyone see it.

**Goal:** Survive Camp Silver Lake without humiliation, count down the days until she can return home to her books and solitude, and avoid drawing any attention to herself that might lead to rejection or embarrassment.

**Fear/Obstacle:** Lily is terrified of being truly seen and found wanting—of someone looking past her quiet exterior and deciding there's nothing worthwhile underneath.

**Arc:** Lily begins the summer hiding behind books and a fantasy crush that feels safe because it's unattainable. Through Jamie's persistent attention and genuine interest, she learns to risk being seen for who she really is. By summer's end, she discovers that being visible to the right person isn't terrifying—it's where real connection begins. She moves from passive observer of life to active participant, from hiding behind safe fantasies to embracing real, vulnerable love.

## Love Interest: Jamie Sullivan

**Age:** 17

**Background:** Jamie comes from money but wishes he didn't. His parents divorced two years ago in a bitter split where both moved on quickly to new relationships, leaving Jamie feeling like an inconvenience to both households. He's been shuffled between his father's new apartment and his mother's new family, never quite belonging in either place. Camp Silver Lake is where his parents can park him for the summer without having to deal with him. He's been expelled from two prep schools for increasingly elaborate pranks.

**Personality:** Smart, irreverent, perceptive, and using humor as armor. Jamie has a reputation as a troublemaker, but it's largely because he stopped caring about meeting anyone's expectations after his parents made clear he was a problem to be solved rather than a son to be loved. He masks his pain with jokes and pranks, keeping people at arm's length. But underneath the troublemaker facade, he's observant, creative, and desperately lonely. He notices things others miss—especially quiet girls who hide in corners with books.

**Initial Barrier:** Jamie seems like exactly the wrong kind of boy for Lily—loud, disruptive, attention-seeking, everything that makes her uncomfortable. His constant teasing feels like mockery, and his refusal to let her hide in peace seems cruel. She views him as an obstacle to her quiet summer and her fantasy of catching Michael's attention.

**Hidden Depth:** Jamie's troublemaking is a test—he acts out to see who'll look deeper, who'll bother to understand why rather than just punish the behavior. His teasing of Lily isn't mockery but curiosity and genuine interest. He sees her intelligence, her careful observations, the person she is beneath the invisibility she projects. He's been writing stories all summer—something no one knows about—and Lily inspires him to create something meaningful instead of destructive.

**Arc:** Jamie begins as the boy who can't leave Lily alone because she's the first person in years who interests him more than his own pain. As he shares his real self with her—his hurt over his family, his secret writing, his fear that he's as unwanted as his parents make him feel—he transforms from defensive troublemaker to someone willing to be vulnerable. He learns that being seen can be healing, and that making someone else feel valued is more satisfying than any prank.

## Supporting Cast

### Betty Wilson - Best Friend/Cabin-mate
Lily's cabin-mate and the closest thing she has to a friend at camp. Betty is warm, outgoing, and genuinely kind—the type who tries to include everyone. She notices Lily's crush on Michael immediately and tries to be supportive, though she gently hints that Lily might be aiming too high. Betty sees Lily's potential and encourages her to participate in camp activities. She also notices Jamie's interest in Lily before Lily does, and serves as a sounding board when Lily is confused about her feelings. Betty provides the cheerleader energy Lily needs, never pushy but always encouraging.

### Michael Grant - The Fantasy Crush
Twenty-year-old senior counselor and star of the camp swimming program. Michael is genuinely nice—friendly, responsible, encouraging with all campers—but treats everyone with the same pleasant distance. He's handsome, athletic, the golden boy who seems to have everything together. Michael is completely oblivious to Lily's crush and sees her only as a helpful, quiet camper who volunteers for activities. He's dating Dorothy Hayes, another counselor, but doesn't broadcast the relationship. Michael represents the safe fantasy—unattainable, which means Lily can never be rejected, never have to risk real vulnerability.

### Dorothy Hayes - Michael's Girlfriend
Twenty-year-old counselor who runs arts and crafts. Dorothy is confident, talented, and has the easy charisma of someone comfortable in her own skin. She's kind to Lily when they interact, never condescending. Dorothy represents everything Lily thinks she isn't—beautiful, confident, naturally social. Learning about her relationship with Michael shatters Lily's fantasy but ultimately frees her to see what's real.

### Tommy "Sparky" Mitchell - Jamie's Friend/Accomplice
Seventeen-year-old camper and Jamie's partner-in-crime for pranks. Sparky is tech-savvy for 1957 standards, loves chaos, but has a good heart underneath. He gives Jamie grief about being "soft" on Lily and serves as comic relief. Sparky notices Jamie's feelings evolving and eventually becomes supportive of the relationship, even helping with Jamie's talent show surprise. He provides the friendship that shows Jamie isn't completely isolated—he just hasn't let anyone really know him until Lily.

### Camp Director Patricia Morrison
Fifties, has run Camp Silver Lake for twenty years. Stern but fair, she knows every trick campers try and doesn't tolerate nonsense. She's caught Jamie multiple times but sees potential underneath his troublemaking. Mrs. Morrison calls Lily into her office mid-summer to ask if everything is okay, showing she notices the quiet ones too. She represents the adult awareness that both Jamie and Lily need more than they're getting from their own parents, providing structure and surprising understanding.

## Setting: Camp Silver Lake, Northern Michigan

**Time:** Summer 1957

**Key Locations:**
- **The Lake:** Center of camp life with a dock, swimming area marked by floating rope, and canoes. The dock becomes Lily's refuge and the site of key romantic moments with Jamie.
- **The Mess Hall:** Large wooden building where meals and evening activities happen. Features long tables, a small stage for announcements and the talent show, and a jukebox that plays current hits.
- **Girls' Cabins (Pine Grove):** Rustic cabins housing six girls each. Lily shares Cabin 7 with Betty and four other girls. Screen windows, bunk beds, trunk storage.
- **Arts & Crafts Building:** Where Dorothy runs activities. Lily volunteers here to be near Michael. Paint-splattered tables, lanyard supplies, leather-working tools.
- **The Bonfire Circle:** Stone fire pit surrounded by log benches near the lake. Site of nightly campfire songs, marshmallow roasting, and the final bonfire where Lily and Jamie's relationship becomes public.

**Period Details:** Summer of 1957 brings Elvis on every radio, poodle skirts even at camp, saddle shoes for evening socials. Camp features weekly "record hops" in the mess hall where campers dance to 45s. Letters home are written weekly and mailed from the camp office. No phones except emergency use in director's office. Flashlights for night, kerosene lanterns in cabins.

**Atmosphere:** Silver Lake captures innocent, wholesome summer camp nostalgia—swimming lessons, campfire songs, mosquito bites, and summer crushes. The northern Michigan setting provides cool evenings perfect for bonfires, pine-scented air, and star-filled skies. The camp has structured activities but enough free time for reading by the lake or sneaking away after lights-out. It's a self-contained world where parents and real life feel far away, and eight weeks stretches into its own universe.

## Tone & Voice

First-person POV from Lily's perspective. Her narrative voice is intelligent and observant but self-deprecating—she notices everything but interprets it through her lens of insecurity. The tone is gently nostalgic, capturing 1957 summer camp innocence while staying emotionally honest about teen feelings. Lily's voice becomes gradually more confident as summer progresses. She uses period-appropriate language naturally—"swell," "keen," "dreamy"—but not heavily. The emotional register is earnest without being melodramatic, matching Sweet Dreams sensibility: real feelings, genuine stakes for a teen, but fundamentally hopeful and sweet-natured.

## Theme

"Waves and Wishes" explores the difference between fantasy and reality in first love. Lily must learn that the safe crush—the unattainable boy who can never reject you—isn't real connection. Real love requires vulnerability, being seen completely, risking that someone might look at the real you and walk away. The theme asks: What if the person who won't leave you alone is actually the person who sees you best? Lily's journey is learning to trade the safety of fantasy for the risk and reward of authentic connection. She discovers that being invisible keeps you safe but also keeps you alone, and that the right person doesn't want the polished version—they want the real you, book-obsessed quirks and all.

## Romance Trope(s)

**Primary Trope:** Love Interest Mistake—Lily pursues the wrong boy (Michael) while the right boy (Jamie) is right in front of her all along. This manifests through the summer as Lily fixates on unavailable Michael while Jamie persistently draws her attention, sees her clearly, and ultimately proves he's the one who understands her heart. The "wrong boy turns out to be right" structure drives the emotional arc, with the realization scene at the talent show serving as the moment Lily's fantasy crashes and reality steps in.

**Secondary Trope:** Opposites Attract—Quiet bookworm meets loud troublemaker. Their differences initially seem like incompatibility but prove complementary. Jamie draws Lily out of her shell; Lily grounds Jamie's chaos. They balance each other.

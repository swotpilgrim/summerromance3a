# Chapter 11: The Michael Project Continues

I volunteer to organize the waterfront supply shed without being asked.

"That's very kind of you, Lily," Michael says at morning announcements, looking genuinely pleased. "The equipment has gotten pretty disorganized with all the swimming classes. If you don't mind spending your free period sorting it, that would be a huge help."

"I don't mind at all," I say, trying to sound casual instead of desperately eager.

Betty gives me a look that clearly says *you're pathetic*, but I ignore her. This is exactly what I need—time alone with Michael, away from the chaos of camp, where maybe we can have a real conversation. Where maybe he'll see me as more than just a helpful camper.

On the walk to the shed after lunch, I practice what I might say. I could ask about his major at University of Michigan. Or what he wants to do after graduation. Or whether he likes teaching swimming, whether he's ever thought about coaching...

By the time I reach the shed, I have three different conversation starters prepared and my heart is racing.

---

The shed is cramped and musty, smelling of canvas and lake water. Life jackets hang from hooks on one wall, paddles are stacked haphazardly in the corner, and coils of rope have somehow gotten tangled together. It's a mess, which means I'll have plenty of time to work alongside Michael.

He's already there, pulling down life jackets to sort by size.

"Hey! Ready to tackle this disaster?" He grins, and my stomach flips. "I swear it gets worse every summer. You'd think counselors would know how to put things away properly."

"Where should I start?"

"Maybe the paddles? We need to separate canoe from kayak, and check for any damage." He tosses me a rag. "Wipe them down too, if you don't mind. Lake grime builds up."

I settle into the work, wiping down paddles and organizing them by type. We work in companionable silence for a few minutes, and I build up courage to use one of my prepared conversation starters.

"So, what are you studying at U of M?"

"Business administration." He doesn't look up from sorting life jackets. "Not particularly exciting, but practical. My dad owns a sporting goods store, so I'll probably go into the family business eventually."

"Do you like it? Business?"

"It's fine. Pays the bills, or will someday." He moves to the next pile. "Swimming is my real passion though. I'm on the university team—backstroke specialist."

"That's impressive."

"Thanks. I'm hoping to make nationals this year, but we'll see. The competition is brutal."

I wait for him to ask about me—what I like, what I want to study, anything. But he just keeps sorting life jackets, his mind clearly on swimming competitions rather than our conversation.

"I like to read," I offer, filling the silence. "I'm thinking about studying literature, maybe."

"That's nice. English was never my strongest subject." He laughs. "I'm more of a numbers guy. Give me statistics over Shakespeare any day."

The conversation dies. I focus on the paddles, trying not to feel disappointed. This is going fine. We're talking. It's just... not what I imagined.

Twenty minutes pass. We've settled into an efficient rhythm—me on paddles, him on life jackets and safety equipment. The silence isn't uncomfortable exactly, but it's not charged with possibility either. It's just two people doing a chore.

I'm about to try another conversation starter when footsteps approach outside.

"Michael? I brought you—oh!" Dorothy Hayes appears in the doorway, carrying a glass pitcher of lemonade and two cups. Her face lights up when she sees Michael, then shifts to pleasant surprise when she notices me. "Lily! I didn't realize you were helping too."

"Lily volunteered," Michael says, and his entire demeanor changes. His face lights up, his voice warms, his body language shifts from polite to genuinely happy. "She's been amazing—we're almost done."

"You're a lifesaver, Lily." Dorothy sets down the pitcher. "I made lemonade for the counselors, but Michael mentioned he'd be stuck organizing all afternoon. Thought he could use refreshment."

"You're the best." Michael takes the pitcher from her hands, their fingers brushing, and the casual intimacy of it hits me like a wave. "Want to stay and help? Make it a party?"

Dorothy laughs. "Can't—I have to prep tomorrow's craft project. But I'll see you at dinner?" There's a question in her voice, something private and shared.

"Absolutely."

They smile at each other, and I might as well be invisible. This isn't casual counselor friendliness. This is something else entirely—something comfortable and established and completely exclusive of everyone else.

Dorothy waves goodbye to me on her way out, friendly and kind, completely unaware that she just shattered something fragile I'd been protecting.

Michael pours lemonade into both cups and hands one to me. "She's great, isn't she? We've been working together all summer—she makes everything more fun."

I sip the lemonade. It's perfect—tart and sweet and ice-cold. Everything Michael says about Dorothy is true. She does make things more fun. She's creative and warm and easy to be around.

She's also clearly more than a colleague.

We finish organizing in relative silence. When everything is sorted and put away properly, Michael steps back and surveys our work with satisfaction.

"This looks fantastic. Thank you so much, Lily. You're incredibly reliable and organized—I really appreciate it."

*Reliable and organized.* The words should make me happy. Instead, they land like a weight in my chest. That's how he sees me. Not as interesting, not as someone he wants to know better. Reliable. Organized. A helpful child.

"You're welcome," I manage.

"I should get ready for evening activities. Thanks again—you really saved me a lot of time." He gives me that easy, friendly smile—the one he gives everyone—and heads out.

I stand alone in the newly organized shed, surrounded by life jackets and paddles, feeling more foolish than I have in my entire life.

---

At dinner, I push food around my plate without eating. Betty tries to make conversation, but I'm barely listening. Across the mess hall, Michael sits with the other counselors. Dorothy is beside him, and they're laughing about something, their heads close together.

I'm such an idiot.

"Lily?"

I look up to find Jamie standing beside my table, tray in hand. He's not grinning for once—just looking at me with genuine concern.

"Mind if I sit?"

Betty's eyebrows shoot up, but she scoots over to make room. Jamie slides in across from me.

"So," he says, poking at his mystery meat, "how'd Operation Golden Boy go this afternoon?"

I should snap at him for calling Michael that. Instead, I just shrug.

"That bad?" His voice is gentle, not mocking.

"He called me reliable and organized."

"Ouch."

"And Dorothy brought him lemonade. They were..." I trail off, not wanting to say it out loud.

"Very couple-y?" Jamie finishes. "Yeah. That's been pretty obvious for a while."

"Why didn't anyone tell me?"

"Would you have listened?" He asks it kindly, but it still stings because he's right. I wouldn't have. I would have insisted I was different, that Michael and I had a connection, that Dorothy was just a friend.

I would have kept believing the fantasy because it was safer than risking reality.

Jamie stands and disappears toward the serving line. I assume he's leaving, but he returns a minute later with two chocolate pudding cups—the good dessert that always runs out fast.

"Here." He slides one across to me. "Emergency chocolate pudding. Medicinal purposes only."

Despite everything, I smile. "Where did you get two? They're always gone by the time I get there."

"I have my ways. Mostly involving befriending the kitchen staff and helping them move heavy things." He digs into his pudding. "So listen, I know this sucks right now. But it's also maybe... better? Than spending all summer pining for someone who was never going to see you?"

"How is this better?"

"Because now you can actually enjoy camp instead of torturing yourself. Read your books without analyzing whether you saw him at breakfast. Try activities because you want to, not because he's teaching them. Maybe even notice the people who actually do see you."

I look at him—really look at him. Jamie, who mocked my crush and ruined my book and also somehow became my friend. Who's sitting here with emergency chocolate pudding instead of saying "I told you so."

"Is this what friends do?" I ask. "Show up with dessert when you're miserable?"

"Yeah. Friends do that." He grins, the familiar mischievous spark returning. "Also, I stole Sparky's pudding. He's going to be mad. Want to hear the ridiculous excuse I gave him?"

"Yes."

He launches into an elaborate story about needing pudding for a "science experiment" involving ants and the camp flagpole. It's completely absurd and definitely a lie, but it makes me laugh for the first time since this morning.

Betty watches us with undisguised interest, but she doesn't interrupt.

"Thank you," I tell Jamie when the story ends.

"For the pudding or the company?"

"Both."

"Anytime, book girl." He stands, grabbing his tray. "And hey—Michael's loss. He's too busy being professionally nice to everyone to notice when someone actually interesting is paying attention to him."

He walks away before I can respond, leaving me with half-eaten chocolate pudding and a strange warm feeling in my chest that has nothing to do with Michael Grant.

Betty waits exactly three seconds. "Okay, we need to talk about Jamie."

"There's nothing to talk about."

"Lily Palmer, that boy just stole pudding for you and called you interesting. There is definitely something to talk about."

"He's my friend."

"Mmhmm. Friends who look at each other like that."

"Like what?"

"Like you're the most important person in the room." Betty leans forward. "And you didn't even notice Michael and Dorothy leave five minutes ago, because you were too busy watching Jamie tell his story."

I look toward the counselor table. She's right—Michael and Dorothy are gone. And I didn't notice. Didn't even care.

"I think I'm more confused than ever," I admit.

"Welcome to feelings. They're confusing." Betty grins. "But at least they're real."

Real. Jamie's favorite word lately. Real instead of safe. Real instead of fantasy.

I finish my emergency chocolate pudding and think about how Jamie knew exactly what I needed before I did.

Maybe Betty has a point.

Maybe I have been looking at the wrong boy all along.

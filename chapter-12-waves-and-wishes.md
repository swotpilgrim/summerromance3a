# Chapter 12: Jamie's Uncomfortable Truth

Jamie intercepts me after breakfast, falling into step beside me as I head toward morning activities.

"We need to talk."

There's no playfulness in his voice, no grin on his face. He's serious in a way I've rarely seen, and it makes my stomach tighten.

"About what?"

"About something you're not going to like." He glances around at the other campers streaming past. "Not here. Come with me?"

I should probably say no. The tight set of his jaw suggests this conversation is going to be exactly as unpleasant as he's promising. But curiosity and a strange sense of inevitability makes me nod.

"Fine."

He leads me away from the main camp, down a path that curves along the lakeshore toward a more isolated stretch of beach. We walk in silence, and with each step, my anxiety builds. Jamie is never this serious. Whatever he wants to say must be important.

Finally, we stop at a spot where large rocks meet the water, far enough from camp that our voices won't carry. The morning sun glitters on the lake, and dragonflies dance over the cattails. It should be peaceful. Instead, it feels ominous.

Jamie turns to face me, hands shoved deep in his pockets, and takes a breath like he's about to dive into cold water.

"I'm going to say something, and you're going to want to argue with me. But I need you to actually hear it first, okay?"

"Jamie, you're scaring me."

"Good. Maybe that'll help you listen." He runs a hand through his hair—a tell I've learned means he's uncomfortable. "Michael doesn't see you that way, Lily. He's not going to fall for you. He treats you exactly like he treats every other camper—with professional friendliness and nothing more. The way a big brother treats a kid sister."

The words land like a slap. I open my mouth to argue, but he holds up a hand.

"Let me finish. Please." His voice gentles. "I know it's not what you want to hear. I know you've spent weeks building this whole thing up in your head. But watching you hope for something that's never going to happen is—it's painful. And I can't keep watching it."

"Why do you care?" The question comes out defensive, sharp. "What does it matter to you what I hope for?"

"Because we're friends!" He says it like it should be obvious. "Because friends don't let friends waste their entire summer chasing someone who will never look at them the way they want to be seen."

"You don't know what Michael thinks."

"I have eyes, Lily. Everyone has eyes. He looks at you the same way he looks at that twelve-year-old who dropped her papers at orientation—with generic kindness and zero romantic interest. He looks at Dorothy like—" He stops himself.

"Like what?"

"Like she matters. Like she's someone he cares about. Like she's his girlfriend, which she is."

The certainty in his voice makes something crack in my chest. "You don't know that."

"Don't I?" Jamie's frustration is clear now. "They're together constantly. They have inside jokes. They touch each other's arms and lean close when they talk. He lights up when she walks into a room. That's not 'just friends,' Lily. That's what it looks like when someone is actually interested."

"Stop."

"No. You need to hear this." He steps closer, and his eyes are intense, almost pleading. "You're in love with an idea, not a person. You don't know Michael. You don't know his favorite color or what makes him laugh or what he's afraid of or anything real. You've built this whole fantasy in your head where he's perfect and unavailable, which makes him safe to want. But it's not real."

"That's not—"

"It is. You want him because you can't have him. Because that way, you never have to risk anything. You get to spend all summer with this safe little crush, and then you go home with your heart intact and your walls still up, congratulating yourself for feeling something when you never actually felt anything real at all."

Tears prick at my eyes. His words are cutting too close to truths I haven't wanted to examine.

"Why are you being so cruel?"

"I'm not being cruel. I'm being honest. There's a difference." His voice cracks slightly. "Cruel would be letting you keep doing this, watching you build up this whole thing in your head, knowing it's going to crash down eventually. Cruel would be staying silent and letting you waste the whole summer on someone who doesn't even know you exist as anything other than a helpful camper with good organizational skills."

"I hate you."

"Right now, you probably do. But you need to hear it from someone who actually cares about you."

The words hang in the air between us. *Someone who actually cares about you.*

"If you cared," I say, my voice shaking, "you wouldn't be trying to ruin the one thing that makes this camp bearable."

"If that crush is the only thing making camp bearable, then you're doing it wrong!" He's frustrated now, voice rising. "You should be making actual friends. Actually participating in things you enjoy. Actually living instead of watching from the sidelines and pining for someone who gives you the exact same smile he gives everyone else."

"You don't understand anything." Tears are falling now, hot and angry. "You don't know what it's like."

"To hide?" He laughs bitterly. "I know exactly what it's like. I just hide differently than you do. You hide behind books and safe crushes. I hide behind pranks and noise. But we're both hiding, Lily, and it's pathetic. At least I'm trying to change it."

"By ruining my summer?"

"By trying to be your friend! By trying to tell you the truth before it hurts worse later!" He takes a step back, composing himself. "When the summer ends and you go home, do you want to look back on eight weeks of watching someone from a distance and calling it a crush? Or do you want to look back on a summer where you actually lived, where you made real connections with people who actually see you?"

"People like you?" I throw the words at him like a weapon.

"Yeah. Like me." He doesn't flinch. "I see you, Lily. I see how smart you are and how careful and how scared. I see you hiding and I see you trying and I see all of it. And I'm telling you that you deserve better than worshiping someone from afar who doesn't even know you. You deserve someone who looks at you and sees everything you are, not a reliable helper with alphabetized books."

The intensity in his voice, the rawness of it, steals my breath. We stand there in the morning sun, six feet apart, and for a moment I see it—I see how Jamie looks at me. Like I matter. Like he knows me. Like every single thing he's saying comes from a place of genuine caring.

And it terrifies me.

"I can't," I whisper.

"Can't what?"

"Can't be what you want. Can't be brave enough to risk real things with real people. Can't stop wanting the safe fantasy even though you're right and I know you're right and I hate that you're right."

He looks at me for a long moment, and something sad crosses his face. "I'm not asking you to be anything. I'm asking you to stop settling for nothing."

"Why?" The word bursts out of me, desperate and confused. "Why do you care so much? Why does it matter to you what I do with my summer?"

Jamie is quiet for so long I think he won't answer. When he finally speaks, his voice is soft.

"Because watching someone disappear into themselves when they have so much to offer is the saddest thing I've ever seen. Because you remind me of all the ways I've made myself small to avoid being hurt. Because somewhere between ruining your book and sitting on rocks together, you became my friend, and I don't want to watch my friend waste herself on nothing."

"It's not nothing to me."

"Then that's the saddest part of all." He turns toward the path. "I'm not going to tell you what to do, Lily. If you want to spend the rest of the summer chasing Michael Grant, that's your choice. But you deserve to know the truth from someone who's paying attention. He doesn't see you. He's never going to see you. And the longer you keep hoping, the more it's going to hurt when you finally admit it."

He walks away, leaving me standing alone by the water with tears streaming down my face and the terrible suspicion that everything he said is true.

I sink onto a rock and let myself cry—not pretty, delicate tears but harsh, ugly sobbing that shakes my whole body. Because Jamie's right. Because Michael will never look at me the way he looks at Dorothy. Because I've been hiding behind a safe fantasy instead of living. Because the truth hurts and I've been running from it for weeks.

And because the one person who sees me clearly enough to speak that truth is Jamie Sullivan, who I've spent half the summer trying to avoid.

I cry until I have no tears left, until the sun has climbed higher and the morning has worn on toward lunch. Then I wipe my face, square my shoulders, and head back toward camp.

I don't know what to do with everything Jamie said. I don't know how to let go of the safe fantasy I've been nurturing. I don't know how to be brave enough for real things.

But I do know one thing: I can never look at Michael the same way again. Jamie has taken the fantasy and held it up to the light, and now I can see all the cracks.

I just wish it didn't hurt so much to see them.

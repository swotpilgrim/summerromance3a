# Chapter 13: The Fight

I avoid Jamie for three days.

It's not hard—camp is big enough that with careful planning, I can ensure we're never in the same place. I eat breakfast early or late. I skip evening campfire. I choose activities I know he won't attend. When I see him from a distance, I turn the other way.

Betty notices but doesn't push. She just gives me sympathetic looks and occasionally asks if I'm okay. I'm not, but I don't want to talk about it.

Instead, I throw myself into Michael's activities with renewed determination. Jamie thinks I'm wasting my summer? I'll prove him wrong. I'll show him that Michael does see me, that I'm not just building fantasy castles in my head.

On the third day, I sign up for advanced swimming even though I'm not advanced. Michael is teaching a new diving technique, and I force myself into the cold water with single-minded focus.

"Nice to see you pushing yourself, Lily," Michael says when I volunteer to demonstrate. "Your form has really improved."

The compliment should feel like vindication. Instead, it feels hollow. He's smiling at me the same way he smiles at everyone—pleasant, professional, impersonal. But I cling to it anyway, because admitting Jamie was right would mean admitting I've wasted weeks.

From the dock, I can see Jamie. He's been confined there for his latest prank—something involving the camp flagpole and what I heard was technically non-toxic but very smelly. He's supposedly cleaning equipment, but mostly he's just sitting there, watching.

Watching me.

I execute the dive as perfectly as I can, and when I surface, Michael is nodding approvingly. "Well done. See, everyone? That's the technique we're looking for."

I climb out of the water feeling like I've proven something, though I'm not sure what.

After lunch, I head to arts and crafts. I've been avoiding this pavilion because Jamie sometimes shows up during free period, but today I don't care. I have as much right to be here as he does.

I'm working on a lanyard—a mindless activity that requires no thought—when a shadow falls across my table.

"So you're just going to ignore me forever?" Jamie drops onto the bench across from me, no smile, no playfulness. Just flat challenge.

"I'm not ignoring you. I'm busy."

"You're avoiding me. There's a difference."

"Maybe I don't want to talk to you."

"Because I told you the truth?"

The words spark anger in my chest. I set down my lanyard carefully. "Because you were cruel."

"I was honest."

"Same thing, sometimes."

"No," Jamie says firmly. "It's really not. Cruel would be letting you keep pining for someone who sees you as a helpful kid. Cruel would be watching you waste your summer and saying nothing."

"You've made your point. Multiple times. Can you leave me alone now?"

"Not until you stop this." He gestures vaguely toward the lake where swimming class just ended. "I saw you out there. You're working yourself into the ground trying to prove I'm wrong."

"Maybe you are wrong."

"Lily—"

"He complimented my diving. He said my form improved. He noticed me."

Jamie's expression shifts to something that might be pity, which makes me even angrier. "He notices everyone's progress. That's literally his job."

"You don't know that."

"I do know that. And so do you, if you'd stop lying to yourself."

People are starting to stare. Dorothy, working at the front table, glances our way with concern. I lower my voice but can't lower my anger.

"Why can't you just let me have this?"

"Because it's not real! You're not having anything—you're watching from a distance and calling it connection. You're building fantasy and calling it feelings. You're hiding and calling it hope."

"Stop." My voice shakes.

"No. Someone has to say it. Someone has to care enough to—"

"You don't care about me. You just want to feel superior by tearing down what I care about."

Jamie recoils like I've slapped him. "That's not—you actually think that?"

"I don't know what to think. All I know is you've spent weeks making me feel stupid for liking someone, mocking my crush, ruining my—"

"Making you feel stupid? I'm trying to be your friend! I'm trying to help you see that you deserve—"

"I don't want your help!" The words come out too loud. Dorothy stands, moving toward us.

"Maybe you two should take this outside," she suggests gently but firmly.

Jamie's jaw tightens. He stands abruptly and walks toward the door. After a moment's hesitation, I follow.

Outside, away from the pavilion but still on the path where anyone could hear, the argument explodes properly.

"You don't want my help?" Jamie rounds on me. "Fine. Keep torturing yourself over someone who will never want you back. Keep hiding behind books and safe fantasies. Keep being so terrified of actually feeling anything real that you'd rather worship someone from afar for eight weeks than have one genuine conversation with someone who sees you."

"You don't see me. You just see someone to fix, some project to make yourself feel better about your own life."

"My own life?" His voice goes quiet, dangerous. "What does that mean?"

I should stop. I can see the warning in his expression, the hurt beneath the anger. But something vicious and wounded inside me wants to hurt him back.

"It means maybe you're so busy criticizing how I spend my summer because you can't stand to think about your own situation. At least I have parents who care enough to send me somewhere nice. At least I'm not being dumped at camp because I'm an inconvenience."

The words hang in the air like poison.

Jamie's face goes completely blank—that defensive mask slamming down so fast I barely see it happen. But not before I catch a flash of real pain, deep and devastating.

"Jamie, I—"

"You're right," he says, voice flat and cold. "My parents don't want me. They made that abundantly clear. And yeah, I'm an inconvenience they parked at camp for the summer. Good job figuring that out. Really insightful."

"I didn't mean—"

"Yes, you did. You meant to hurt me, and congratulations, it worked." He laughs, but there's no humor in it. "You know what the difference is between us, Lily? I hide behind noise and pranks, but at least I know I'm hiding. You hide behind books and fantasies and this whole wounded act, and you actually think you're being brave. You actually think pining for Michael Grant is feeling something. But it's not. It's the safest, most cowardly option you could choose. Because real feelings? Real people? Those might actually require you to be vulnerable. Those might actually hurt."

"At least I'm not acting out like a child, causing trouble for attention!"

"At least when I cause trouble, people notice I exist! You're so desperate to be invisible that you've succeeded—nobody sees you, including the guy you claim to want. And that's your choice, Lily. You chose invisible. You chose safe. You chose to spend eight weeks watching life happen to other people instead of actually living it yourself."

"I hate you."

"Good. At least that's a real feeling." He turns to walk away, then stops. "One more thing. You want to know why I cared? Why I couldn't just let you keep doing this? Because somewhere in the past two weeks, I started actually giving a damn about you. And watching someone I care about settle for nothing when they could have something real was killing me. But go ahead—keep pining for Golden Boy. Keep building your safe little fantasy. I'm done watching."

He leaves, and I stand there trembling with anger and shame and the crushing weight of what I just did.

I weaponized his pain. I took the vulnerable thing he shared with me—about his parents, about feeling unwanted—and I used it to hurt him. And I succeeded.

The anger drains away, leaving only sickening regret.

"Lily?" Betty appears from somewhere, concern written across her face. "What happened? Everyone heard you two shouting."

"I..." I can't finish the sentence. Tears are coming, hot and horrifying. "I said something terrible."

"What did you say?"

"I—his parents—he told me they don't want him, and I just—" The tears spill over. "I used it against him. I was so angry and I wanted to hurt him and I did."

Betty pulls me off the path, away from curious eyes. "Oh, Lily."

"I'm a terrible person."

"You're a person who said something terrible. There's a difference." She hands me a tissue. "Can you apologize?"

"I don't know if he'd listen."

"That's his choice. But you should try."

I nod, but I can't imagine what I'd say. *I'm sorry I threw your trauma in your face*? *I'm sorry that when you tried to help me see reality, I attacked the thing that hurts you most*?

The truth is, Jamie was right about everything. Michael doesn't see me. I've been hiding. I've been choosing safe over real. And when someone called me on it, when someone cared enough to push me toward something better, I repaid him with cruelty.

I slump against the tree, tears falling freely now. Betty stays with me, not saying anything, just being there.

And all I can think about is Jamie's face in that split second before his mask came down—the flash of real, devastating pain that I caused.

I don't think I've ever hated myself more than I do right now.

# Chapter 14: The Long Silence

Four days.

Four days of successfully avoiding Jamie Sullivan, and each one feels longer than the last.

I thought avoiding him before our fight was hard. This is worse. Before, I was avoiding someone who annoyed me. Now I'm avoiding someone I hurt, someone whose pain I can't stop seeing every time I close my eyes.

Camp feels emptier than it did when I first arrived. I go through the motions—morning activities, meals, evening programs—but nothing feels right. Even reading doesn't help. I open *The Secret Garden* and can't focus on the words. Mary Lennox's transformation feels too close to what Jamie was trying to tell me, and I can't bear to read it.

I see him sometimes, from a distance. He's reverted to full troublemaker mode—louder, more reckless, pulling pranks that get him confined to cleanup duty almost daily. Yesterday it was a water balloon ambush on the counselors. Today he rigged the mess hall doors to play a kazoo chorus when opened. Tomorrow, who knows.

But there's no joy in it. Even from across the mess hall, I can see that his laughter is too loud, his grin too wide, his energy forced. It's all performance, armor against feeling. The Jamie who sat with me on the rocks and talked about hiding is gone, replaced by the Jamie who hides so well nobody can see he's hurting.

I did that. I pushed him back behind his walls.

The worst part is watching him with Sparky and other campers. He's still funny, still charismatic, still the center of attention. But I can see what they can't—that it's hollow. That he's running on empty, filling the space with noise so no one looks too close and sees the hurt underneath.

Once, at breakfast, I catch him looking at our old rock spot from across the camp. His expression is unguarded for just a second, and the loneliness in it makes my chest ache. Then someone calls his name and the mask is back, grin firmly in place.

I want to go to him. I want to apologize. But I don't know if sorry is enough for what I did.

Betty doesn't push me to talk about it, but her concern is obvious. She watches me pick at my food, sees me lying in my bunk during free period instead of going to our spot by the rocks, notices how I flinch whenever someone mentions Jamie's name.

On the fourth day, she finally breaks.

"Lily, this is ridiculous."

I'm lying on my bunk, staring at the ceiling, listening to rain hammer the cabin roof. A storm rolled in this morning, canceling outdoor activities and trapping everyone inside. Most of our cabin-mates are at the rec hall playing games, but I stayed behind, claiming a headache.

"What is?"

"This. You and Jamie. You're both miserable."

"I'm fine."

"You're lying in bed at two in the afternoon. That's not fine." Betty climbs halfway up the ladder to my bunk, her face appearing at eye level. "I saw Jamie at lunch. He looked terrible. Like he hasn't slept in days."

The information hits me harder than it should. "He's probably just tired from his pranks."

"His pranks have gotten worse. Did you hear about the stink bomb in the counselor meeting? Or the fake spider in Mrs. Morrison's coffee? He's going to get sent home if he keeps this up."

I roll onto my side, facing away from her. "That's not my problem."

"Isn't it though?" Betty's voice is gentle but firm. "You two had something good. A real friendship. And yeah, you both said terrible things. But friendships are supposed to survive fights. That's what makes them real."

"I said something unforgivable."

"Did he tell you it was unforgivable?"

"He walked away."

"After you told him you hated him." Betty climbs another rung, undeterred by my resistance. "Lily, from what you told me, he was trying to help you. Maybe not in the best way, maybe too bluntly, but he was trying. And you were hurting and lashed out. That's human. But staying broken isn't."

"I don't know how to fix it."

"Start with sorry. See where it goes from there."

She climbs down and heads toward the door, probably to join the others at the rec hall. At the door, she pauses.

"You know what I think? I think you miss him. I think maybe he was right about some things and you can't stand admitting it. And I think he's probably just as miserable as you are, which means he probably misses you too."

She leaves me alone with the rain and my thoughts.

That evening, the storm breaks enough for a shortened campfire. I almost don't go. The thought of sitting there, pretending everything's fine, watching Jamie from across the flames—it sounds unbearable. But staying in the cabin feels worse than facing camp, so I trudge to the fire circle in the damp twilight.

The fire struggles against the moisture in the air, smoking more than blazing. Wood hisses and pops, sending up sparks that die before reaching the low-hanging clouds. People cluster on benches, damp and subdued. The usual campfire energy is missing, dampened by the weather and the general midweek exhaustion that settles over camp sometimes.

Michael plays guitar halfheartedly, and even the usually enthusiastic campers seem tired. A girl from Cabin Five starts "Kumbaya" but it peters out after one verse. Mrs. Morrison tells a ghost story that falls flat. The whole thing feels listless.

I find a seat at the back, trying to be invisible. It works for maybe ten minutes. I focus on the struggling fire, watching smoke curl and twist in the damp air, trying not to think about anything at all.

Then I see Jamie across the fire, sitting with Sparky and a few other boys. He looks terrible—Betty was right. Dark circles under his eyes, hair more disheveled than usual, a certain flatness to his expression that makes my chest tight. He's laughing at something Sparky said, but the laugh sounds wrong. Too loud. Too forced.

As if he can feel my gaze, he looks up. Our eyes meet across the fire, and for a moment everything else fades. The struggling flames, the halfhearted singing, the damp evening chill—it all disappears. I see hurt there, and anger, but also something that might be longing, or maybe that's just wishful thinking.

For three heartbeats, we just look at each other. I want to mouth "I'm sorry" or give some signal that I regret everything, but I can't move.

Then his mask slams back into place. He looks away deliberately, turning to say something to Sparky that makes the other boy laugh too loudly. The moment is gone, severed as cleanly as if he'd used scissors.

The message is clear: we're done.

I leave campfire early, walking back through the damp evening with tears threatening. The path is muddy from the rain, and puddles reflect the emerging stars. Somewhere in the trees, a bird calls its evening song. It's beautiful and peaceful, and I feel absolutely miserable. In the cabin, I pull out paper and start writing a letter home. Not the cheerful, mandatory weekly letter. A real one, about how I've made my first real friend and immediately destroyed the friendship. About how I'm exactly as invisible as I feared I'd be, but now it's by my own choice.

I write three pages and then rip them up. My parents don't want to hear about my failures. They want to hear that camp is "great" and I'm "making friends" and I'm "coming out of my shell."

What they won't understand is that I did come out of my shell, just long enough to hurt someone who cared about me.

I lie in my bunk that night, listening to Betty's soft breathing below and the other girls' quiet murmurs. Someone giggles at a joke I didn't hear. Another girl pages through a magazine, the rustle of paper oddly loud in the darkness. Through the screen window, I can see stars emerging as the clouds clear, bright and indifferent to human drama.

Jamie's words from our fight echo in my mind, relentless as the tide: *At least when I cause trouble, people notice I exist. You're so desperate to be invisible that you've succeeded.*

He was right. About everything. I chose invisible. I chose safe fantasies over real connections. I chose to hide behind a crush on Michael—a man I didn't know, who didn't know me, who represented safety precisely because he was unattainable. I chose to waste weeks on a fantasy rather than risk one moment of real vulnerability.

And when someone tried to help me see what I was doing, when someone cared enough to push me toward something better, I repaid him with the cruelest thing I could think of. I took his pain about his parents—the vulnerable truth he'd shared in moonlight by the dock—and I weaponized it.

The memory makes me physically sick. The look on his face when I said it. The way his mask slammed down, hiding the hurt I'd caused. The way he recovered and threw my own truth back at me, calling me a coward for choosing fantasy over reality.

He was right about that too.

The truth settles over me like a weight: I miss Jamie. Not the way I thought I "missed" Michael when he wasn't around—that was just fantasy withdrawal. I miss actual Jamie. His laugh, his insights, his way of calling me out while somehow making me feel seen. I miss having someone to talk to who understands hiding. I miss our spot by the rocks, the comfortable silences, the way he could make me laugh even when I was determined to be miserable.

I miss my friend.

And I have no idea if he'll ever forgive me for weaponizing his pain.

Rain starts again, soft and steady against the cabin roof. I pull my blanket higher and let myself acknowledge what I've been avoiding for four days:

Losing Jamie's friendship hurts worse than Michael's indifference ever could.

Because Michael was never real. But Jamie was.

And I destroyed it.

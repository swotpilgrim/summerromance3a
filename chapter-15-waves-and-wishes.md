# Chapter 15: The Book Apology

The package on my bunk is wrapped in brown paper, tied with twine.

I stare at it for a long moment before picking it up. It's after lunch on the seventeenth day of camp, and I came back to the cabin to grab my flashlight for this afternoon's nature hike. I wasn't expecting to find anything.

There's no name on the package, but I know immediately who it's from. My hands shake slightly as I untie the twine and unfold the paper.

*To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee. A hardcover copy, slightly worn, with a library stamp from some town in Illinois I've never heard of.

A note is tucked inside the front cover, written in Jamie's messy handwriting:

*I'm sorry. I was a jerk about how I said things, even if I wasn't wrong about what I said. You don't have to forgive me, but I miss talking to you. - J*

I sit down on my bunk hard, clutching the book. He's apologizing to me. After everything I said, after the cruel words I threw at him about his parents, he's the one saying sorry.

The unfairness of it makes tears prick my eyes.

I read the note three more times, tracing the letters with my finger. *I miss talking to you.* Such simple words. Such an enormous admission from someone who hides as carefully as Jamie does.

I need to fix this. Now. Today.

I tuck the book carefully under my pillow and head out, skipping the nature hike entirely. I know where he'll be.

---

Our spot by the rocks looks exactly the same—the flat stones warm in the afternoon sun, the cattails swaying in the breeze, dragonflies hovering over the water. But it feels different knowing I might not be welcome here anymore.

I almost turn back three times on the walk over. What if he's not there? What if he is there but doesn't want to see me? What if sorry isn't enough?

But when I push through the tall grass, he's sitting on his usual rock, skipping stones across the water. He doesn't turn around, but his shoulders tense. He knows I'm here.

I sit on my rock—the one I claimed that first day we shared this space—and leave distance between us. For a long moment, neither of us speaks. Jamie keeps skipping stones with intense concentration, and I watch the ripples spread across the water's surface.

"I got the book," I finally say. "Thank you."

"You're welcome." His voice is carefully neutral.

"Jamie, I—" The words stick in my throat. "I need to say something."

He skips another stone. Five perfect skips before it sinks. "Okay."

"Do you really think I'm hiding?" I ask quietly.

He finally looks at me, surprise crossing his face. Whatever he expected me to say, it wasn't that. "Yeah. I do."

"Do you think I'm the only one?"

A ghost of a smile. "No. I hide too. Just differently."

"You said your pranks are your version of my books."

"They are." He turns back to the water. "I'm loud and chaotic and cause trouble because at least that way people notice I exist. Even if they're noticing me for the wrong reasons."

"And I'm quiet and invisible because I'm terrified of being noticed and found wanting."

"Yeah."

We sit with that truth between us. A fish jumps somewhere out on the lake. The breeze carries the scent of pine and warm earth.

"You were right," I say. "About Michael. About me hiding behind a safe fantasy. About all of it."

"Lily—"

"No, let me finish. Please." I take a shaky breath. "You were trying to help me, and I knew it even then. But it hurt to hear it because you were right, and admitting that meant admitting I've been wasting my time. Wasting my summer. Choosing safe over real."

He's watching me now, fully turned toward me, stone-skipping forgotten.

"And when you pushed me to see that, when you cared enough to tell me the truth even knowing I'd hate hearing it, I—" My voice breaks. "I took the thing that hurts you most and I used it against you. Your parents. What you told me about feeling unwanted. I weaponized it because I wanted to hurt you as much as you were hurting me."

"Lily, it's—"

"It's not okay." Tears are falling now. "It was cruel. It was the worst thing I could have said, and I knew it when I said it. I saw your face. I saw how much it hurt. And I'm so, so sorry."

Silence. Jamie looks at me with an expression I can't read. Then he sighs, long and heavy.

"I was too harsh," he says. "The way I said things. I knew they'd hurt and I said them anyway because I was frustrated. I cared about you and you were so determined to waste your time on Michael that I—I lost my patience."

"You cared about me."

"I did. I do." He says it simply, like it's fact. "You're interesting and smart and you see things other people miss. And watching you settle for fantasy when you could have reality was killing me."

"What reality?" I ask, though I think I might know the answer.

"Friendship. Real conversations with people who actually see you. A summer spent living instead of watching." He pauses. "Me. Paying attention to you. Seeing you."

The words settle between us, heavy with meaning.

"I hurt you," I whisper.

"Yeah. You did." He doesn't sugarcoat it. "That thing about my parents—that landed exactly where you meant it to."

"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

"I know you are. And I'm sorry too. For pushing too hard, for being too blunt, for forgetting that truth doesn't mean much if you deliver it like a hammer."

We sit in silence again, but it's different now. Softer. The anger has drained away, leaving just hurt and regret and the fragile possibility of repair.

"So," Jamie says eventually. "Where does that leave us?"

"I don't know. Can you forgive me?"

"Can you forgive me?"

"I already have. There was nothing to forgive—you were trying to help."

"There was plenty to forgive. I was cruel too, even if I thought I was being helpful." He shifts on his rock. "But yeah. I forgive you. We both said things we regret. That's what happens when people who care about each other fight."

"Is that what we are? People who care about each other?"

"I think so. At least, that's what I'd like to be."

Relief floods through me. "Me too."

Jamie grins—his real grin, not the mask version. "Good. Because sitting here alone the past few days has been boring as hell. Turns out I'd rather share this spot with someone who yells at me sometimes than have it to myself."

Despite everything, I laugh. "I don't yell."

"You yelled pretty loud during our fight."

"You were being infuriating."

"And you were being stubborn."

"We're both kind of terrible."

"Yeah." His grin widens. "But we're better terrible together than apart."

It's the truest thing anyone has said to me in weeks. We are better together—two people learning not to hide, learning to be real, learning that friendship means fighting and repairing and choosing each other anyway.

"Thank you for the book," I say again.

"Thank you for coming here. I wasn't sure you would."

"I wasn't sure I'd be welcome."

"You're always welcome." He says it firmly, leaving no room for doubt. "Real friends fight and fix things. That's what makes them real—they survive the hard parts."

Real. His favorite word, and it's becoming mine too.

"So we're okay?" I ask.

"Better than okay." He stands and offers me his hand. "We're friends who fought and made up, which means we're actually friends now. Real ones."

I take his hand and let him pull me to my feet. His grip is warm and steady, and when he lets go, I miss the contact immediately.

"Want to skip stones?" he offers. "I'll teach you my technique."

"Deal."

We spend the rest of the afternoon by the water, skipping stones and not talking about anything important. He shows me how to find the right flat stones and how to angle my wrist. I'm terrible at it—my best is three skips—but he's encouraging instead of mocking.

When the dinner bell rings from camp, we walk back together. It feels easy in a way it hasn't since before our fight. Maybe easier, because we've tested the friendship and it held.

"Hey Lily?" Jamie says as we reach the fork where our paths split.

"Yeah?"

"For what it's worth, I really am glad you came today. I missed this."

"Me too."

He grins and heads toward the boys' section. I watch him go, and the lightness in my chest is almost overwhelming.

I have my friend back. More than that, I have a real friendship—one that survived hurt and anger and terrible words. One that's stronger for being tested.

And somehow, losing Michael's fantasy attention doesn't hurt at all anymore.

Because Jamie's real friendship is worth more than a thousand safe crushes.

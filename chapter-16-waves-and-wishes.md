# Chapter 16: The Talent Show Announcement

The mess hall erupts in excited chatter the moment Mrs. Morrison finishes her announcement.

"The annual Camp Silver Lake talent show will be held two weeks from Friday! Sign-up sheets are posted by the door. Everyone is encouraged to participate, either performing or helping with production. This is our camp's oldest tradition and biggest event of the summer!"

Around me, girls are already planning. Betty's table is debating whether to do a comedy sketch or a musical number. Another group is discussing a synchronized swimming demonstration. Even the quieter campers are whispering about possibilities.

I sink lower on my bench, relieved I can just watch from the sidelines.

Then Michael stands up from the counselor table.

"I'll be directing the show this year," he announces with that easy smile. "Dorothy will handle sets and costumes. We need someone organized to manage lighting cues and backstage coordination. It's technical work, but crucial to making the show run smoothly."

Before I can process what's happening, Dorothy speaks up. "Actually, I'd like to recommend Lily Palmer for the position. She's been incredibly reliable helping with activities, and she has great attention to detail."

Every head in the mess hall turns toward me. My face flames.

Michael's smile warms. "Lily, would you be interested? I know it's a lot of work, but you'd be perfect for it."

My heart leaps into my throat. Two weeks working closely with Michael, being essential to his show, proving myself valuable to him. It's everything I wanted before Jamie made me question wanting it.

But that was before. Before our fight, before our reconciliation, before I admitted Michael is just a fantasy.

Except Michael is looking at me with genuine hope, and Dorothy is smiling encouragingly, and everyone's watching, and my mouth opens before my brain catches up.

"Yes. I'd love to help."

The mess hall applauds politely, and I want to sink through the floor. What did I just agree to?

After announcements, I'm intercepted by Jamie before I can escape to morning activities.

"So," he says, falling into step beside me. "Lighting and backstage for the talent show?"

"Dorothy recommended me."

"And you said yes."

"Michael asked me directly. What was I supposed to say?"

Jamie is quiet for a moment, and when he speaks, his voice is careful. "I'm not going to tell you what to do. But are you sure you want to set yourself up for disappointment?"

"It's just technical work. Managing lights and cues. Nothing romantic about it."

"Lily—"

"I know, okay? I know he doesn't see me that way. I know it's professional. I'm not building another fantasy. I'm just helping with a show."

He doesn't look convinced. "If you say so."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"It means I've watched you volunteer for every Michael activity all summer, convincing yourself each time it's just coincidence or just being helpful. And now you're signing up to spend two weeks working closely with him and telling yourself it doesn't mean anything."

The observation stings because it's partially true. But it's also not the whole truth.

"Maybe I just want to be useful. Maybe I want to contribute to camp instead of hiding all the time."

"Then do it because you want to, not because he asked."

I stop walking, turning to face him. "Why do you care so much?"

"Because we're friends. Friends point out when friends are walking into obvious situations."

"It's not— I'm not—" I struggle to find words. "I'm going into this with eyes open. I know Michael and Dorothy are together. I know he sees me as a reliable helper, not a potential girlfriend. I'm not expecting anything else."

"Good." Jamie searches my face like he's trying to determine if I'm lying to him or to myself. "Just... be careful, okay? Don't let him take you for granted."

"I'll be fine."

He nods slowly. "For what it's worth, you do have talents worth showing. If you ever wanted to perform instead of hide backstage."

The comment catches me off-guard. "I don't have any talents."

"You think that. But it's not true." He grins suddenly. "Anyway, I signed up to perform. Fair warning—it's going to be either really good or spectacularly embarrassing."

"What are you doing?"

"Secret." His grin widens. "You'll see on show night."

Before I can press for details, he jogs off toward archery, leaving me standing on the path wondering what just happened.

The first planning meeting is that afternoon. I arrive at the mess hall to find Michael and Dorothy already there, surrounded by poster board and markers. Michael waves me over enthusiastically.

"Lily! Perfect. Let me show you the lighting setup."

He leads me to the side of the stage area where a simple control panel is mounted—just six switches controlling different combinations of spotlights and general lighting. It's not complicated, but coordination will be key.

"Each act will have specific lighting needs," Michael explains, standing close enough that I can smell his aftershave—something clean and woody. "We'll create a cue sheet with timing for each switch. You'll need to watch the stage and hit cues perfectly. Think you can handle it?"

"Yes."

"Great!" His genuine enthusiasm is infectious. "Dorothy and I will handle auditions and blocking. You'll take notes on lighting requirements for each act. We're a team."

A team. The word makes something flutter in my chest, even though I know he means it professionally.

Over the next hour, we plan the schedule. Auditions tomorrow, rehearsals all next week, dress rehearsal the day before the show. Dorothy sketches set ideas while Michael lists potential acts. I take meticulous notes, organizing everything by date and priority.

"You're amazing at this," Michael comments, reading over my shoulder. "So organized. This is exactly what we needed."

Dorothy glances up from her sketches and smiles at me. "I told you she'd be perfect. Lily has that rare combination of reliability and creativity."

I should feel valued. Instead, I feel like a particularly useful tool that's been selected for the right job.

When the meeting ends, Michael thanks me again, then turns to Dorothy. "Want to grab dinner together before evening activities?"

"Absolutely."

They leave together, their easy comfort with each other obvious in every gesture. I watch them go and wait for the sting of jealousy.

It doesn't come. Just a mild sense of observation, like watching characters in a book.

Maybe I really am getting past this.

That evening, I find Jamie at our spot by the rocks. He's sketching something in his notebook, but he closes it when I sit down.

"How was the planning meeting?"

"Fine. The lighting system is simple. I think I can handle it."

"I know you can. I wasn't worried about that."

"Then what were you worried about?"

He considers the question. "That you'd spend two weeks watching Michael direct and fall back into the fantasy. That you'd forget you deserve someone who actually sees you."

"I won't forget."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

We sit in comfortable silence, watching the sunset paint the water in shades of orange and pink. Somewhere across the lake, a loon calls its haunting song.

"Jamie? What's your secret talent show act?"

He grins mysteriously. "You'll see."

"Come on, give me a hint."

"Nope. It's a surprise." His grin softens. "But I will say this—I've been working on it for weeks. It's not a prank or a joke. It's something real."

Real. There's that word again.

"I can't wait to see it."

"I hope you like it."

There's something in his voice—an uncertainty, a vulnerability—that makes me look at him more closely. But before I can ask what he means, he's standing and stretching.

"Campfire in twenty minutes. Want to walk back together?"

"Sure."

As we head back toward camp, I think about talent shows and lighting cues and the difference between fantasy and reality. I think about Michael's professional appreciation and Jamie's genuine concern.

And I realize that somewhere in the past few days, being around Jamie has started to feel more important than being noticed by Michael.

I'm not sure when that shift happened.

But I think I'm glad it did.

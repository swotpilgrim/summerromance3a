# Chapter 16: The Talent Show Announcement

Mrs. Morrison taps the microphone at breakfast on the eighteenth day of camp, and the mess hall slowly quiets.

"Campers, I have an exciting announcement," she says. "The annual Camp Silver Lake Talent Show will take place three weeks from today."

The mess hall erupts. Girls shriek and grab each other's arms. Betty clutches my wrist, bouncing in her seat.

"We have to do something together!" she says. "Our whole cabin! A comedy sketch or a dance routine!"

Around us, campers are already making plans. I shrink down in my seat, already imagining myself backstage. Helping. Invisible. Useful but not seen.

Mrs. Morrison taps the microphone again. "Sign-ups will be posted this afternoon. I expect creative, appropriate acts. Nothing dangerous, and nothing that will embarrass this camp. You have three weeks to prepare. Dismissed."

The energy as everyone leaves breakfast is electric. I follow Betty outside, listening to her spin increasingly elaborate ideas for our cabin's act, when I see Michael standing near the bulletin board with Dorothy. They're both holding clipboards, looking official and in charge.

My heart does that stupid fluttering thing it still does when I see him.

"I should go see what they need help with," I tell Betty.

She gives me a look that's equal parts sympathetic and exasperated, but doesn't argue. "I'll be at the cabin working on ideas if you want to join us later."

I approach the bulletin board slowly, not wanting to seem too eager. Michael is tacking up a sign-up sheet while Dorothy writes something in her neat handwriting. I'm close enough to see "Talent Show Planning Committee" at the top of her paper when Michael notices me.

"Lily," he says, smiling in that friendly, impersonal way of his. "Just the person I wanted to see."

My stomach flips. "You were?"

"We need someone reliable to handle lighting cues and curtains. Dorothy said you've been wonderful organizing supplies—very detail-oriented. We'd love to have you on the crew. What do you think?"

Three weeks working closely with Michael. Being personally chosen by him. Maybe this is my chance to show him I'm more than just a helpful camper.

"I'd love to," I say, trying to sound calm instead of desperately eager. "I've never done lighting before, but I'm a fast learner."

"Wonderful!" Michael checks something off his clipboard. "We'll have our first planning meeting tomorrow afternoon. The lighting board is simple—I'll teach you everything you need to know."

Dorothy is watching me with a gentle expression that I can't quite read. "It's going to be a lot of work, but it's fun."

"That sounds swell," I say. Three weeks working with Michael. Maybe even having real conversations that go beyond organizing life jackets.

"Great. See you tomorrow at three." Michael is already turning back to his clipboard, the conversation clearly over.

I float away from the bulletin board, barely seeing where I'm going.

I'm halfway to the cabin when Jamie steps out from behind the arts and crafts building, nearly making me jump.

"Whoa, easy there, bookworm," he says, holding up his hands. "Didn't mean to startle you."

"You did anyway." But I'm smiling. Things have been better between us since our reconciliation at the rocks. Easier. More honest.

"So," he says, falling into step beside me. "I saw you talking to Michael. Let me guess—Operation Golden Boy has entered a new phase?"

I should be annoyed by his teasing, but the words come out too gently to sting. "He asked me to help with the talent show. Lighting and technical stuff."

Jamie's expression shifts, something unreadable crossing his face. "He did, huh?"

"Dorothy recommended me. Michael said I'm reliable and detail-oriented." I can't quite keep the pride out of my voice.

We walk in silence for a moment.

"Lily," Jamie says finally, his voice more serious than usual. "Are you sure that's a good idea?"

The question deflates my happiness like a pin to a balloon. "What do you mean?"

"I mean—" He runs a hand through his hair, looking frustrated. "I mean you're setting yourself up for three weeks of being close to him, working with him, building up all these expectations. And at the end, you're still going to be disappointed."

"You don't know that."

"I kind of do, though." He stops walking and turns to face me. "He asked you to help because you're reliable. Because Dorothy told him you're good at organizing things. Not because he's interested in you that way."

The words hurt precisely because they echo my own secret fears. "So I shouldn't help? I should just hide in my cabin instead?"

"That's not what I'm saying." Jamie looks torn, like he's trying to figure out how to say something difficult. "I'm saying... prepare yourself. Don't build this up into something it's not."

"Maybe you're wrong. Maybe this is exactly the chance I need to show him I'm not just some kid."

"Maybe," he says, but he sounds doubtful. "Or maybe you're wasting three weeks chasing someone who's never going to see you the way you want to be seen."

"Why do you care so much?" The question comes out sharper than I intended.

Jamie looks at me for a long moment, his expression unreadable. "Because we're friends. And watching you set yourself up to get hurt sucks."

Before I can respond, he adds, almost under his breath, "Besides, you have talents worth showing. You could perform something yourself instead of hiding behind the lighting board."

The comment catches me off guard. "I don't have any talents."

"Yes, you do. You're just too scared to let anyone see them." His tone has lost its edge, turning almost gentle. "But it's your choice. If you want to spend the next three weeks being Michael's invisible helper, that's your call."

He walks away before I can answer, leaving me standing on the path with my happiness thoroughly complicated.

The first planning meeting happens the next afternoon in the mess hall. Michael and Dorothy are already there when I arrive, along with two other counselors.

"Lily! Perfect timing." Michael waves me over to a metal panel mounted on the wall. "This is our lighting board. Pretty simple system—just six switches that control six overhead lights. Basic spotlights and blackouts, nothing fancy."

I join him, hyperaware of how close we're standing. He smells like soap and sunscreen.

"See? This one is stage left, this one is stage right, these two are center spots..." He flips switches, and lights click on and off above us. "During the show, you'll follow my cues. I'll be in the back row with a script, and I'll signal when to change the lights."

"That doesn't seem too hard," I say, watching the patterns of light shift across the empty stage.

"It's not, but timing is everything. If you bring up the lights too early or too late, it can ruin a whole act." He smiles at me, that friendly counselor smile that never quite reaches his eyes when he looks at campers. "But I trust you. Dorothy said you're great at following directions."

Following directions. Reliable. Detail-oriented. I'm being praised for being obedient and useful, not for being interesting or special.

Jamie's words echo in my head: *He asked you because you're reliable, not because he's interested.*

I push the thought away.

Dorothy calls Michael over to discuss set construction, and I watch them work together. They move around each other with an easy familiarity, finishing each other's sentences and laughing at private jokes. When she reaches for a pencil, he hands her one before she can even ask.

They're a team. A unit. And I'm standing at the lighting board, taking notes.

The meeting lasts an hour. I learn about curtain pulls, safety protocols, and rehearsal schedules, writing everything down carefully.

When we're dismissed, Michael thanks everyone for their help. "This is going to be a great show," he says. "I'm really excited to work with all of you."

His eyes pass over me the same way they pass over everyone else—friendly, appreciative, distant.

I gather my things slowly, watching Michael and Dorothy confer in low voices. She says something that makes him laugh, and he bumps her shoulder affectionately.

I head out, notebook clutched against my chest.

Over the next few days, I throw myself into learning the lighting system. I practice during free periods until I can flip switches without looking. I make charts of which acts will need which lights.

Betty watches this with increasing concern. "You're kind of obsessed," she says one evening as I study my notes instead of playing cards.

"I'm being thorough."

"You're being something." She leans closer. "Have you noticed Jamie's been scarce lately?"

I have noticed. Usually he finds me at least once a day, but since the talent show announcement, he's been absent.

"He's probably planning some elaborate prank," I say.

"I don't think so." Betty lowers her voice. "Rachel saw him at the arts and crafts building after hours. And Sparky says Jamie signed up to perform."

That surprises me. Jamie Sullivan, performing? "He's probably going to do something ridiculous."

But Betty shakes her head. "That's what's weird. Everyone says he's being really secretive about it. Won't tell anyone what his act is. He's been spending hours working on some kind of project."

I think about what Jamie said—that I have talents worth showing. Maybe he's taking his own advice.

"Well, I guess we'll find out in three weeks," I say, trying to sound indifferent.

But later, lying in my bunk after lights out, I wonder what Jamie could be preparing that requires secrecy and hours of work. It doesn't match his usual chaotic, spontaneous style.

And I wonder why the thought of him performing makes my stomach flutter in a way that has nothing to do with nervousness and everything to do with curiosity.

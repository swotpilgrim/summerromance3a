# Chapter 17: Warnings and Wishes

Rehearsals begin three days after the first planning meeting, and the mess hall transforms into something between organized chaos and actual theater.

I arrive early on the first day, nervous about running the lights for real performers. What if I mess up someone's cue?

"Lily, perfect. Come help me set the schedule." Michael waves me over to where he's arranging sign-up cards. "We've got twenty-three acts total. We need to figure out running order."

I sit beside him, close enough that our shoulders almost touch. We sort through the cards together—Sparky's magic act, the Benson twins' duet, Betty's cabin comedy sketch.

"Here's Jamie Sullivan," Michael says, holding up a card. "He wouldn't tell me what his act is. Just wrote 'spoken word performance' on the sign-up. Any idea what that means?"

I shake my head. "He's been secretive about it."

"Well, hopefully it's not a prank." Michael sets the card aside with a slightly worried expression. "He's talented when he applies himself, but he has a history of turning things into jokes."

Except Jamie said this was something real, something that mattered. But I don't share that with Michael.

The first rehearsal is rough. A girl named Susan forgets her lyrics halfway through "Love Me Tender" three times. One of the younger boys bombs his comedy routine. The Benson twins argue about harmonies until Dorothy mediates.

Through it all, I watch Michael work. He's patient with every performer. When Susan starts crying, he tells her a story about forgetting his lines in a school play. She laughs, relaxes, and gets through the song on the fourth try.

I flip light switches on cue, trying to be invisible and useful. Michael gives me thumbs up when I time something perfectly, and my heart races.

During a break, Michael asks me to practice more complicated cue sequences.

"This act needs a spotlight that moves from stage left to center to stage right. Think you can handle that?"

"I think so."

"Good. I'll pretend to be the performer. You work the lights."

He walks onto the stage, and I flip switches to follow him. Left spot up, center spot up, right spot up.

"Excellent!" he calls. "You're a natural at this, Lily. Really intuitive with the timing."

Pride swells in my chest. Michael Grant thinks I'm good at something.

He hops off the stage and joins me at the lighting board. "You know, I'm thinking about studying theater in college. Maybe directing. There's something special about taking all these different elements—actors, lights, sets, music—and creating something that moves people."

"That sounds wonderful," I say, and I mean it. His face lights up when he talks about directing, his usual friendly distance replaced by genuine passion.

"It's one of the reasons I wanted to run this talent show. Real directing experience, you know? Even if it's just camp kids singing Elvis songs." He grins. "Dorothy thinks I should go for it. She's applying to art school herself."

Of course she is. They probably talk about their future plans together all the time, encouraging each other's dreams.

"I think you'd be a great director," I say.

"Thanks, Lily. That's nice of you to say." He glances at his watch. "We should probably call the next act. Can you go tell the Benson twins they're up?"

Just like that, the moment ends. He's back to business, and I'm back to being his helpful assistant.

I head toward the door where performers are waiting, and that's when I see Jamie leaning against the wall near the entrance. He's watching me with an expression I can't read. When our eyes meet, he straightens up and slips outside.

I find him after rehearsal, sitting on the steps outside the mess hall. The late afternoon sun casts long shadows across the camp, and most people have scattered to dinner or evening activities.

"How long were you watching?" I ask, sitting down beside him.

"Long enough." He's picking at a loose thread on his rolled jeans, not looking at me. "How's it going? The whole lighting thing?"

"Good. I think I'm getting the hang of it."

"And Michael? Still treating you like his star pupil?"

There's an edge to his voice that makes me defensive. "He's teaching me how to do lights. What's wrong with that?"

Jamie finally looks at me, and his expression is serious in a way that reminds me of when he told me the truth about Michael not seeing me. "Lily, I need to warn you about something."

My stomach tightens. "What?"

"The talent show. When it happens. I just—" He runs a hand through his hair, frustrated. "I don't want you to get hurt."

"Why do you keep saying things like that? If you know something, just tell me."

"I can't. It's not—" He stops, shakes his head. "Just prepare yourself, okay? For the show. Things might not go the way you're hoping."

"What things? Jamie, you're being cryptic and it's not fair."

"I know. I'm sorry. But I promise, after the show, everything will make sense." He stands, looking down at me with an expression that's equal parts worried and determined. "Just remember that I'll be there, okay? Whatever happens, I'll be there."

Before I can push for more answers, he walks away, leaving me sitting on the steps with more questions than before.

What does he know that I don't? What's going to happen at the talent show?

That evening, Betty corners me in our cabin while the other girls are at the campfire.

"Okay, spill," she says, flopping onto my bunk. "What's going on with you and Jamie?"

"Nothing's going on."

"Please. He's been acting weird for days."

I busy myself organizing my bookshelf. "He's just being mysterious about his talent show act."

"It's more than that." Betty sits up. "Dorothy says Jamie's at the arts and crafts building almost every night, working on some project."

"What kind of project?"

"She wouldn't say. But she said it was 'really sweet' and 'from the heart.'" Betty leans forward. "She also said Jamie asked her questions about you. What you like, what kind of books you read, what makes you happy."

My stomach does a weird flip. "Why would he ask about me?"

"Oh, I don't know. Maybe because he's been obviously into you since like the second week of camp and you're the only person who hasn't noticed?"

"He is not—" I stop. "Betty, we're just friends."

"Are you? Because the way he looks at you doesn't seem very friendly. It seems like—" She pauses, choosing her words carefully. "It seems like the way you look at Michael. Except Jamie actually looks back."

The observation lands like a stone in still water, sending ripples through everything I thought I understood.

"I don't know what you're talking about," I say, but my voice sounds uncertain even to my own ears.

Betty gives me a long, knowing look. "Okay. But maybe pay attention at the talent show. I have a feeling Jamie's performance is going to be... illuminating."

She leaves to join the others at the campfire, and I stay behind, sitting on my bunk with a book I'm not actually reading.

Jamie asked Dorothy questions about me. He's working on something from the heart. He keeps warning me about the talent show like something significant is going to happen.

*I made it for you.*

That's what he said before. About his performance. That he made it for me.

But what does that mean?

---

The next day passes in a blur. Swimming lessons where I barely pay attention. Lunch where I don't taste the food.

I'm looking for Jamie without admitting to myself that I'm looking for him. But he's nowhere.

During afternoon free time, he finds me.

I'm walking back from the library cabin when he appears on the path, stepping out from behind the dining hall like he's been waiting.

"Can we talk?" he asks.

My heart rate picks up. "Okay."

We walk toward the lake in silence, bypassing the main beach for a quiet stretch of shore where a fallen log makes a natural bench.

Jamie sits, and I join him, leaving careful space between us.

"I owe you an explanation," he says. "About the warnings and the cryptic comments."

"Okay."

He picks up a stick and drags it through the sand, drawing random patterns. "The thing I'm working on for the talent show. It's..." He trails off, struggling with words.

"It's what?" I prompt gently.

"It's important to me. More important than anything I've done in a long time." He glances at me, then away. "And it's about—it involves—" Another pause. "I made it for you. Because you matter."

The words hang in the air between us, heavy with meaning I'm almost afraid to examine.

"I matter?" My voice comes out smaller than I intended.

"Yeah. You do." He's still not looking at me, still drawing patterns in the sand. "And I'm terrified I'm going to mess it up, or you're not going to understand what I'm trying to say, or you're going to be too focused on Michael to even notice."

"Jamie—"

"But I have to try. Because for the first time in years, I care about something enough to risk looking stupid. You made me care about that." He finally meets my eyes. "So whatever happens at the talent show, whatever you see or don't see, just know that I tried. That I wanted you to know how—" He stops, swallows. "That I wanted you to know you're worth creating something beautiful for."

My chest feels tight. No one has ever said anything like that to me before. No one has ever looked at me the way Jamie is looking at me right now—vulnerable and nervous and completely sincere.

"I don't know what to say," I whisper.

"You don't have to say anything. Not yet." He stands, brushing sand off his jeans. "Just... be there. At the show. Pay attention. That's all I'm asking."

He walks away before I can respond, leaving me sitting on the log with my borrowed book forgotten in my lap.

My mind is spinning. Jamie made something for me. He thinks I matter. He's terrified and trying anyway.

And somewhere in the back of my mind, a small voice asks: When was the last time Michael made me feel like this?

When was the last time Michael made me feel anything at all?

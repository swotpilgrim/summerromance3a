# Chapter 17: Warnings and Wishes

Rehearsals consume the next several days.

I arrive at the mess hall each afternoon to find it transformed into organized chaos. Campers practice their acts—song-and-dance numbers, comedy sketches, magic tricks, even a dramatic monologue from Shakespeare. Michael moves between performers with patient encouragement, adjusting blocking and offering suggestions. Dorothy paints set pieces in the corner, her creative energy infectious.

And I sit at my lighting station, taking notes and running cues.

It should be tedious, but I find myself enjoying it. There's something satisfying about the technical precision, about hitting each light change at exactly the right moment. I'm good at this. Useful.

Michael thanks me constantly. "You're a lifesaver, Lily. I don't know what we'd do without you."

Each compliment should feel like victory. Instead, it feels like confirmation of exactly what Jamie said—Michael sees me as reliable, organized, helpful. Nothing more.

One afternoon, I'm adjusting the timing on a particularly complex sequence when Michael slides into the chair beside me.

"How's it going?"

"Good. I think I have the cues down for Betty's sketch."

"Excellent." He studies my notes. "You're incredibly organized. This is professional-level work."

"Thanks."

"Have you ever thought about theater? You'd be great on a tech crew."

I blink at him. "Not really. I mostly just read."

"Well, you're a natural." He stands, already moving back toward the stage. "Keep up the great work!"

I watch him go—tall, handsome, kind Michael Grant who sees me as a natural tech crew member. There's no flutter in my chest, no longing, no fantasy spinning out about what he might mean.

Just observation. Just acceptance.

I really am over this crush.

Jamie has been scarce during rehearsals. I catch glimpses of him sometimes—heading toward the arts and crafts building with suspicious determination, or huddled with Sparky over some secret plan. When I ask what his act is, he just grins mysteriously.

"You'll see. Opening night."

"Come on, one hint?"

"Nope. Ruins the surprise."

"I hate surprises."

"You'll like this one." Then his expression shifts to something more serious. "How's the Michael thing going?"

"It's not a 'Michael thing.' It's just rehearsals."

"Mmhmm. And how many times has he called you 'organized' or 'reliable' this week?"

I throw a pine cone at him, which he dodges easily.

"I'm just making sure you're okay," he says. "That you're not falling back into old patterns."

"I'm fine. Honestly. He's just...Michael. Nice, professional, dating Dorothy. I see it clearly now."

"Good." But Jamie still looks concerned. "Just prepare yourself, okay? For the show."

"Prepare myself for what?"

"For things becoming more obvious than they already are." He won't elaborate, no matter how much I press. "Trust me. Just...I'll be there. Whatever happens."

The cryptic warning unsettles me, but Jamie won't explain.

A week into rehearsals, I'm running lighting for the dress rehearsal when Dorothy approaches my station.

"Lily? Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

She perches on the edge of the table, paintbrush tucked behind her ear. "Have you noticed anything...off with Jamie lately?"

The question surprises me. "Off how?"

"He's been in arts and crafts almost every evening. Very serious, very focused. He's working on something for the show, but he won't let anyone see it." She smiles gently. "I think it might be something special. Personal."

"Did he tell you what it is?"

"No. But I've seen the kind of care he's putting into it. Whatever he's creating, it matters to him." She studies me with kind eyes. "I think it might matter to you too."

My face flushes. "I don't know what you mean."

"Don't you?" But she doesn't push. "Just...pay attention on show night. I think you'll be surprised."

She returns to her set painting, leaving me confused and oddly nervous.

What is Jamie planning?

---

Two days before the show, Michael gathers everyone for a full run-through. I sit at my station, cue sheet ready, as acts parade across the makeshift stage. Betty's comedy sketch gets genuine laughs. A trio of girls performs a surprisingly good harmony on "Que Sera Sera." Sparky's magic act is chaotic but entertaining.

When Jamie's turn comes, he tells Michael he'll perform on show night—it's better as a surprise. Michael looks skeptical but allows it.

"It's nothing inappropriate," Jamie assures him. "Just...personal. I want it to be fresh."

After rehearsal, I catch Jamie before he can slip away.

"Okay, seriously. What are you doing for the show?"

He looks at me for a long moment, something vulnerable in his expression. "Something I've never done before. Something that scares me."

"Jamie—"

"I made it for you." The words come out quiet, almost shy. "I've been working on it since we became friends. Since I realized you were someone worth creating something meaningful for."

My heart stutters. "What does that mean?"

"You'll see. Two more days." He touches my shoulder briefly—just his hand resting there for a heartbeat—before walking away.

I stand there, his touch lingering like a brand, and something shifts in my chest. Something that feels less like friendship and more like the beginning of something else entirely.

---

The night before the show, I lie in my bunk unable to sleep. Through the screen window, stars blaze across the summer sky. Betty snores softly below me, and the cabin is full of the peaceful sounds of sleeping girls.

But my mind won't quiet.

I keep thinking about Jamie's hand on my shoulder. About his words: *I made it for you.* About Dorothy's observation that whatever he's creating is special, personal.

About the way my pulse jumped when he touched me.

I think about Michael too—about how his compliments feel nice but hollow. About how watching him with Dorothy doesn't hurt anymore. About how I can see clearly now that what I felt for him was never real, just a safe fantasy that let me feel something without risking anything.

And I think about Jamie—loud, chaotic Jamie who pushed me to be visible, who called me out when I was hiding, who fought with me and forgave me and sees me more clearly than anyone ever has.

Jamie, who is creating something meaningful.

For me.

The realization hits like a wave: I'm not thinking about Michael anymore. I'm thinking about Jamie. Wondering what he's planning. Hoping he knows how much his friendship means. Feeling something that might be more than friendship when I remember his touch.

When did that happen?

When did Jamie Sullivan stop being the annoying boy who ruined my book and become the person I think about most?

I don't have an answer. I just know that somewhere between scavenger hunts and dock conversations and reconciliations by the rocks, something changed.

And tomorrow night, at the talent show, I have a feeling everything is going to change again.

I finally fall asleep as dawn breaks, my last thought a mixture of anticipation and terror about what Jamie's surprise might be.

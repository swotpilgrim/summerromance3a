# Chapter 18: The Reality Sets In

One week until the talent show, and rehearsals shift into high gear.

Michael calls extra practice sessions, extending our time in the mess hall into early evening. The performers are getting better—Susan can make it through "Love Me Tender" without forgetting lyrics, the Benson twins have agreed on their harmony.

I'm getting better too. I can run complicated light sequences without thinking, anticipate Michael's cues before he gives them.

But something else is happening during these long rehearsal days. Something I've been avoiding.

I'm starting to actually see Michael Grant instead of the fantasy I've built around him.

Today, I watch Michael work with a nervous first-year camper named Tommy who's doing a yo-yo act. Tommy keeps dropping the yo-yo, getting more flustered with each mistake.

"That's it, Tommy. You're getting it. Don't worry about the fancy tricks—just focus on the basics."

"But what if I mess up during the real show?"

"Then you mess up. It's not the end of the world." Michael pats his shoulder. "You're doing great."

Tommy beams and runs off. Michael makes a note on his clipboard, then moves on to the next act.

It's the same warm, professional encouragement he gives everyone. Including me.

I think back to all our interactions. He's praised my lighting work, thanked me for being reliable, taught me the technical skills. But he's never asked me anything personal. Never inquired about my life, my interests, what I'm reading.

He doesn't know me at all.

And I don't know him either. I know he wants to study theater in college. I know he's patient with nervous performers. But what else?

I've spent weeks building a romance in my head with someone who's essentially a stranger.

"Lily, can you run the cue sequence for act twelve one more time?" Michael calls from the audience.

"Sure," I say, and flip the switches in order. Stage left, center spot, stage right, fade to black.

"Perfect. You're really good at this, you know." He gives me that friendly smile, the same one he gives Tommy and Susan and every other camper who does something right.

I've been mistaking professional kindness for something more.

Dorothy arrives during the next break, carrying a tray with lemonade and cookies. "Thought everyone could use a snack," she says.

Performers descend on the treats immediately. Michael joins Dorothy by the stage.

"You're a lifesaver," he says.

"I know." She grins at him, and there's something easy in it, something intimate. "How's it going?"

"Good. Everyone's making progress." He reaches for a cookie, and as he does, his hand brushes Dorothy's. Dorothy's smile softens, and Michael's expression shifts into something warmer than his counselor professionalism.

They start talking about the set pieces Dorothy has been painting. I'm close enough to hear, standing at my lighting board.

"I finished the backdrop for act seven," Dorothy says. "The beach scene turned out better than I expected."

"I knew it would. Your stuff always turns out amazing." There's pride in his voice, real pride.

"You have to say that. You're biased."

"I'm honest. There's a difference."

They're standing close, not touching but clearly comfortable in each other's space. Michael leans in to look at the sketch she's showing him. Their heads bend together, and they could be in their own private world.

When Dorothy reaches for her pencil, Michael hands it to her before she can even ask.

They finish each other's sentences. They move around each other with unconscious choreography.

They're clearly together. Obviously together. How did I not see it before?

"All right, everyone, let's run through act fifteen!" Michael calls, stepping away from Dorothy. But not before she touches his arm briefly—a quick, casual gesture of affection that speaks of intimacy and history.

The rehearsal continues. I run lights on cue, mechanical and precise, while my mind processes what I've been refusing to see for weeks.

Michael treats Dorothy differently than he treats anyone else. With her, he's not just a professional counselor. He's softer, more open, more himself. His smiles are real. His attention is complete. He asks her questions and listens to her answers like they matter.

He looks at her the way I wanted him to look at me.

The rehearsal finally ends as dinner time approaches. Performers scatter. Michael and Dorothy start packing up, working together with that same easy coordination.

"Great job today, everyone!" Michael calls. "See you tomorrow, same time!"

I linger at the lighting board, pretending to organize cue sheets that don't need organizing.

Dorothy says something that makes Michael laugh—really laugh. He throws his arm around her shoulders as they head toward the door, and she leans into him naturally.

"You coming, Lily?" Dorothy calls back, noticing me still standing there.

"In a minute. Just double-checking the lighting panel."

"Don't work too hard." She's kind, as always.

They leave together, their voices fading as they walk toward the mess hall.

I stand alone in the empty hall, staring at the lighting board without seeing it.

Michael Grant has never looked at me the way he looks at Dorothy Hayes. He's never asked me personal questions, never leaned in close, never touched my arm in casual affection. He thanks me for being reliable and sees me as a helpful camper who's good at taking instructions.

That's all I've ever been to him. That's all I'm ever going to be.

The truth sits heavy in my chest. Not painful exactly, but definite. Final.

I don't actually like Michael. I like the idea of him—the safe, unattainable crush who could never reject me because I never really tried. The fantasy I could build in my head without risking anything real.

Jamie was right. I've been hiding behind someone who doesn't even know I exist.

I'm still standing there, lost in this uncomfortable realization, when I hear footsteps behind me.

"You okay?"

I turn to find Jamie in the doorway, backlit by the late afternoon sun. He's holding two bottles of Coca-Cola, condensation dripping down the glass.

"How did you know I was still here?" My voice sounds small.

"I didn't. I was just..." He shrugs, walking toward me. "I had a feeling."

He hands me one of the Cokes and sits on the edge of the stage, leaving space for me to join him if I want. I take the Coke—cold and perfect—and sit beside him, not quite touching but close enough to feel his presence.

We don't talk for a long moment. Just sit there drinking our Cokes while the empty mess hall settles into evening quiet around us. Outside, I can hear campers laughing and calling to each other. The dinner bell will ring soon. But for now, this space is just ours.

"I've been stupid," I finally say.

"You haven't been stupid."

"I've spent all summer chasing someone who was never going to notice me. Building up this whole fantasy relationship in my head while he was obviously with someone else. That's pretty stupid."

Jamie takes a long drink of his Coke before answering. "It's not stupid. It's safe. You picked someone unattainable because then you couldn't get hurt. I get that. I do."

"But I'm hurting anyway." The admission surprises me. "Not because I lost Michael—I never had him. But because I wasted all this time on something fake."

"It's not wasted if you learned something from it."

I look at him. He's watching the stage, not me, giving me space to process without feeling observed.

"When did you figure it out?" I ask. "About Michael and Dorothy?"

"First week of camp. They're not trying to hide it. They just don't broadcast it because counselors aren't supposed to be dating." He glances at me. "I thought you knew. Or would figure it out soon. When you didn't, I tried to tell you, but..."

"But I didn't want to hear it."

"Yeah."

We sit in more silence. It should be awkward, but it's not. It's just... comfortable. Real. More real than any interaction I've had with Michael all summer.

"Are you okay?" Jamie asks quietly.

The question is simple but genuine. He really wants to know. Not because he's being professionally polite like Michael, but because he actually cares about the answer.

"I don't know," I admit. "I thought I'd be more upset. Like, heartbroken or devastated. But mostly I just feel stupid for not seeing what was right in front of me."

"You're not stupid. You're human. We all see what we want to see sometimes."

"What do you see?" The question comes out before I can stop it.

He turns to look at me then, really look at me, and his expression is complicated—soft and vulnerable and something else I can't quite name.

"I see someone who's terrified of being known but desperate for real connection. Someone who hides behind books and fantasies because reality seems too risky. Someone smart and interesting and worth knowing, who doesn't believe she's worth knowing." He pauses. "I see you, Lily. The real you. And she's better than any fantasy crush could ever be."

My breath catches. No one has ever said anything like that to me before. No one has ever looked at me the way Jamie is looking at me right now—like I matter, like I'm visible, like I'm enough.

"Jamie—"

"You don't have to say anything. I just wanted you to know." He stands, offering me his hand. "Come on. Dinner bell's about to ring. Betty will send a search party if you're late."

I take his hand and let him pull me to my feet. We walk toward the door together, and I'm acutely aware of the warmth of his hand until he lets go as we step outside.

"Hey, Lily?" he says as we head toward the mess hall.

"Yeah?"

"For what it's worth, you're going to be okay. Better than okay."

"How do you know?"

"Because you're starting to see what's real instead of what's safe. That's always the first step."

He's right. I don't know when it happened exactly, but somewhere between watching Michael with Dorothy and sitting here with Jamie, something shifted. The fantasy is breaking apart, and reality is starting to fill the spaces.

Reality is scarier. But maybe that's because reality actually matters.

# Chapter 18: The Reality Sets In

The week before the talent show, rehearsals intensify. Michael schedules extra run-throughs, perfecting timing and transitions. I spend hours at my lighting station, running cues until I can hit them in my sleep.

And I watch. I watch Michael direct with patient expertise. I watch Dorothy paint sets with creative flair. And I watch how they are together.

It's impossible to miss now that I'm actually looking.

The way Michael's whole face lights up when Dorothy enters a room. The way she brings him coffee without asking how he takes it. The way they finish each other's sentences during planning sessions. The casual touches—his hand on her shoulder, her fingers brushing his arm—that speak of comfortable intimacy.

They're together. Obviously, undeniably together. And they have been all summer.

How did I not see it before?

Because I didn't want to, I realize. Because seeing it meant admitting the fantasy was false, and I needed the fantasy to feel safe.

One afternoon, I'm testing a particularly tricky lighting transition when Michael sits beside me to review the cue sheet.

"This sequence here—can we add a five-second fade instead of a hard cut?"

"Sure. I'll adjust the timing."

"Perfect. You're really good at this, Lily. Have you ever thought about technical theater?"

It's the third time he's asked this week. Each time, I give the same answer.

"Not really. It's just something I'm helping with."

"Well, you should consider it. You have a real talent for it."

He means it as a compliment. I know he does. But all I hear is: *You're good at the technical stuff. At being reliable and organized. At being useful.*

Not: *You're interesting.* Not: *I want to know you better.* Just: *You're competent at this specific task.*

"Thanks," I manage.

Dorothy appears with two glasses of lemonade, handing one to Michael with easy familiarity. "How's it going?"

"Great. Lily figured out that transition I was worried about." Michael accepts the lemonade and smiles at Dorothy in a way that makes his generic friendliness toward everyone else seem flat by comparison. "You're the best."

"I know," Dorothy teases, and they share a look that speaks volumes.

I focus on my cue sheet, pretending to make notes I don't need. They don't notice—they're too wrapped up in each other, discussing set design and costume details with the shorthand of people who know each other well.

After a few minutes, Michael stands. "Let's take a break. Lily, you've got this covered?"

"Yes."

"Great. Dorothy and I are going to grab dinner before tonight's rehearsal."

They leave together, Michael's hand finding the small of Dorothy's back as they navigate through the mess hall door. It's such a small gesture, so natural, that it confirms everything.

They're not just together. They're in love.

And Michael has never, not once, looked at me the way he looks at her.

I sit alone at my lighting station in the empty mess hall, and the truth settles over me with surprising gentleness: I never stood a chance. Not because I'm not good enough, but because I was never what he wanted. He wanted Dorothy—creative, confident Dorothy who matches his energy and shares his passion.

What he saw in me was a reliable assistant. Nothing more.

And strangely, that's okay.

After rehearsal, I sit on the dock watching the sunset paint the sky in shades of orange and pink. The water is calm, mirror-smooth, reflecting the colors perfectly.

Footsteps on the dock announce I'm not alone. I don't need to turn around to know who it is.

Jamie sits beside me, two Coca-Colas in hand. He passes me one without a word.

We drink in silence for a while, watching the sun sink lower.

"How are you?" he finally asks.

"Fine."

"Really?"

I consider lying, but Jamie deserves honesty. "Really. I watched Michael and Dorothy all week. Really watched them, not just what I wanted to see. And it's so obvious they're together. That they're happy. That he looks at her the way I wanted him to look at me."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. You were right all along. He never saw me that way. And I... I don't think I ever actually wanted him. Not really."

Jamie looks at me with something that might be relief. "No?"

"No. I wanted the safety of wanting someone unattainable. I wanted to feel something without risking anything. You called it weeks ago."

"For what it's worth, I wish I'd been wrong."

"I don't." The words surprise me as much as they seem to surprise him. "If I'd kept that fantasy, I would have wasted the whole summer. But I didn't. I made a real friend instead."

"Just a friend?"

The question hangs in the air. I look at him—really look at him in the fading light. Jamie, who pushed me out of my comfort zone. Who called me out and forgave me. Who made me want to be visible instead of hidden.

"I don't know," I admit. "What else could we be?"

He doesn't answer. Just hands me his Coca-Cola and stands, brushing off his jeans.

"You'll figure it out. Eventually." He grins, but there's something soft in it. "See you tomorrow, book girl. Big day."

He leaves me with two Coca-Colas and a head full of questions.

That night, I write in the journal Betty gave me weeks ago—the one I've barely used because I was too busy hiding from my own thoughts.

*Michael is with Dorothy, and that's okay. He's a nice person, but I don't really know him. I don't know his favorite color or what makes him laugh or what he's afraid of. I built a fantasy around someone I never actually talked to, and that's not love. It's not even a crush, really. It's just...safe.*

*Jamie says I'll figure it out eventually. Figure what out? How I feel? What I want?*

*The talent show is tomorrow. Jamie said he made something for me. Made it FOR me, like I matter enough to create something around. No one has ever done that before.*

*I'm terrified to see what it is.*

*I'm more terrified of what it might mean.*

I close the journal and stare at the ceiling. Through the screen window, stars shine indifferent and eternal.

Tomorrow night, everything will change. I can feel it like a storm building on the horizon.

And for once, I'm not hiding from it.

I'm walking straight toward it, eyes open, ready to see what's real instead of what's safe.

Even if what's real scares me more than any fantasy ever could.

# Chapter 19: Jamie's Hidden Depths

The day before the talent show, nervous energy crackles through camp. Performers run through their acts one last time. Dorothy adds final touches to set pieces. Michael reviews the program order obsessively.

And I keep catching glimpses of Jamie sneaking around.

I see him leaving the arts and crafts building just after breakfast, carefully carrying something wrapped in an old sheet. When he notices me watching, he grins and hurries in the opposite direction.

Later, I'm testing lights when curiosity gets the better of me. I find Dorothy alone, painting the final backdrop.

"Can I ask you something?"

"Of course!" She sets down her paintbrush, wiping her hands on her already paint-splattered shorts.

"Jamie's been spending a lot of time here. Working on something."

Dorothy's expression softens into something knowing and kind. "He has. Almost every evening for the past two weeks."

"Do you know what it is?"

"I do, but it's not my secret to tell." She studies me with those perceptive eyes. "I can tell you this—it's beautiful. Thoughtful. He's putting his heart into it."

"Jamie doesn't do thoughtful. He does chaos and pranks and—"

"That's what he wants people to see," Dorothy interrupts gently. "But there's more to him than that. Much more. And I think you might be one of the few people who actually knows it."

My face flushes. "We're just friends."

"Are you?" She's not mocking, just genuinely curious. "Because from where I'm sitting, Jamie Sullivan has been working on the most sincere, heartfelt project I've ever seen a teenage boy create. And when I asked him who inspired it, you know what he said?"

I shake my head.

"He said 'someone who makes me want to be real instead of performative.' That's a direct quote." Dorothy picks up her paintbrush again. "I don't know many seventeen-year-old boys who use the word 'performative,' let alone understand what it means about themselves."

I have no response to that.

That evening, there's a campfire, but it feels different from usual. The talent show tomorrow has everyone buzzing with anticipation. Groups of girls practice their harmonies. Boys run through comedy routines. The energy is electric.

I deliberately choose a seat away from the main crowd, needing space to think. Dorothy's words keep echoing in my mind. *Someone who makes me want to be real.*

"Mind if I sit?"

Jamie. Of course.

"It's a free log."

He sits, but not too close. We watch the fire in silence for a while.

"Big day tomorrow," he finally says.

"Nervous?"

"Terrified." He laughs, but it sounds genuine rather than performative. "I've never done anything like this before. Put something real out there for people to see."

"What is it?"

"You'll find out tomorrow." He picks at the bark on the log. "Dorothy said you were asking about it."

"She wouldn't tell me anything. Just that it's 'beautiful' and 'heartfelt.'"

"Dorothy's biased. She helped me with some of the technical stuff."

"Jamie—"

"Tomorrow," he says firmly. "I'll show you tomorrow. But Lily? I need you to know something."

"What?"

He turns to face me fully, and in the firelight his expression is completely open. No mask, no performance, just honest vulnerability.

"I made it for you. Because you made me want to create instead of destroy. Because you saw past my noise and called me on my hiding. Because somewhere between ruining your book and becoming your friend, you became the most important person in my summer. Maybe longer than that."

My heart is pounding so hard I'm sure he can hear it. "Jamie—"

"I'm not asking you for anything," he continues. "I just wanted you to know. That you matter. That you inspired something real. That—" He stops, running a hand through his hair in that gesture that means he's uncomfortable. "That I see you, Lily Palmer. All of you. And what I see is amazing."

I can't breathe. Can't think. Can only stare at him in the firelight while my entire world shifts on its axis.

"I don't know what to say."

"You don't have to say anything. Not yet." He stands, brushing off his jeans. "Just... watch tomorrow. And maybe you'll understand."

He leaves me by the fire, and I sit there trembling with something that feels too big for my chest.

Later, walking back to Cabin Seven with Betty, she loops her arm through mine.

"Okay, spill. What did Jamie say?"

"How do you know he said anything?"

"Because you've been walking like you're in a daze for the past twenty minutes. And because I have eyes." She squeezes my arm. "Did he finally tell you he likes you?"

"I—what?"

"Lily. Sweet, oblivious Lily." Betty shakes her head fondly. "He's been obviously into you for weeks. Maybe since day one, honestly."

"That's not—we're just—"

"Friends?" Betty laughs. "You keep telling yourself that. But friends don't look at each other the way you two do. Friends don't make grand artistic gestures for each other. And friends definitely don't get that expression you had by the fire when he was talking to you."

"What expression?"

"Like you just realized something that's been true all along."

We reach our cabin, and I climb into my bunk without responding. Betty is wrong. She has to be wrong.

Except...

Jamie's words replay in my mind. *You became the most important person in my summer.* The way he looked at me. The way my pulse raced when he said he sees me.

I pull out my journal and write one sentence:

*What if I've been looking at the wrong boy this entire summer?*

Then I close it and lie awake, staring at the ceiling, counting down the hours until tomorrow when everything Jamie's been hiding will be revealed.

And when I'll finally have to admit what I've been hiding from myself.

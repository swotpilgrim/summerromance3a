# Chapter 19: Jamie's Hidden Depths

Two days before the talent show, I catch Jamie sneaking out of the arts and crafts building after dinner.

The sun is setting, and most people are at the evening campfire. I'm heading back from the library cabin when I see him emerge from the side door, carefully carrying something wrapped in brown paper and twine.

He's moving slowly, like whatever he's holding is precious. His usual casual swagger is gone, replaced by intense concentration.

"Jamie?"

He nearly drops whatever he's carrying. When he sees me, his expression cycles through surprise, nervousness, and something else—protectiveness, maybe?

"Lily. Hey." He adjusts his grip on the package, angling it away from me. "What are you doing out here?"

"I could ask you the same thing." I nod toward the bundle. "What's that?"

"Nothing. Just—it's for the talent show. My act."

"Can I see it?"

"No." The word comes out too quickly, almost panicked. Then he softens. "I mean, not yet. It's not finished. I want you to see it the right way. When it's complete. At the show."

His nervousness is so unlike him that I don't push. Jamie Sullivan, who pranks counselors and breaks rules, is standing here looking genuinely anxious about whatever he's holding.

"Okay," I say gently. "I won't peek."

Relief washes over his face. "Thanks. I know I'm being weird about it. It's just—it matters. What you think. When you see it."

"What I think?"

He looks at me for a long moment, and there's something in his expression I can't quite read.

"Yeah. You." He shifts the package. "I should go put this somewhere safe. See you at campfire?"

"Maybe. I was thinking about skipping."

"Don't." He says it with surprising intensity. "I mean, I'll be there. I'd like it if you were there too."

Before I can respond, he's walking away, carefully cradling whatever secret he's been working on all summer.

I don't go to the campfire right away. Instead, I head to the mess hall to help Dorothy clean up from dinner. She's washing paint brushes in the utility sink.

"Hey, Lily," she says when I come in. "Need something?"

"Just thought you might want help." It's partially true. The other part is that I'm curious about Jamie's mysterious project.

We work in comfortable silence for a few minutes. Dorothy scrubs paint from brushes while I dry and organize them.

"I saw Jamie leaving the arts and crafts building earlier," I say, trying to sound casual. "He was carrying something wrapped up. Looked pretty serious about it."

Dorothy glances at me, a knowing smile playing at her lips. "He's been working on his talent show project every night for weeks. Very dedicated."

"What is it?"

"Not my secret to tell." But her smile grows warmer. "I can say it's something special, though. Really thoughtful. From the heart."

From the heart. That's the second time someone has used that phrase about Jamie's project.

"He asked me questions about you, you know," Dorothy continues, setting a clean brush aside. "What kind of books you like. What makes you smile. Whether you prefer morning or evening. Little details like that."

My stomach does a strange flip. "Why would he ask about me?"

Dorothy gives me a look that's equal parts amused and gentle. "I think you know why, Lily."

"We're just friends."

"Are you?" She doesn't say it unkindly. Just... knowingly. "I've seen the way he looks at you when you're not paying attention. And lately, I've seen the way you look at him when *you* think no one's watching."

Heat creeps up my neck. "I don't—"

"It's okay." She dries her hands. "I just think... maybe pay attention at the talent show. Really pay attention. I have a feeling Jamie's performance is going to be pretty illuminating."

That's exactly what Betty said.

"Dorothy," I say quietly. "How did you know? With Michael. That he was the right person, not just a fantasy."

Her expression softens with understanding. "Oh, honey. You figured it out."

"I've been kind of obvious, haven't I?"

"A little. But it makes sense." She leans against the counter. "You want to know what made me realize Michael was real?"

I nod.

"He asked questions. About my art, my life, what I care about. And he listened to the answers. He remembered details. He wanted to know me, not just the idea of me."

Her words settle into my chest, heavy with truth.

Michael has never asked me questions. He's never wanted to know me.

But Jamie has. Jamie asks about my books and my thoughts. Jamie listens and remembers. Jamie sees the real me and doesn't want me to be anyone else.

"Thanks, Dorothy," I say.

"Anytime." She smiles. "Now go on to that campfire. Someone's probably hoping you'll show up."

---

The campfire is already in full swing when I arrive. Flames dance against the darkening sky, campers scattered on log benches. I scan the crowd and find Jamie sitting with Sparky and a few other guys, laughing.

But when he sees me, his whole face changes. Lights up.

I could sit with Betty and the girls from my cabin. The safe choice.

Instead, I walk over to where Jamie is sitting.

"Room for one more?" I ask.

"Always." He scoots over immediately, making space beside him. "Saved you a marshmallow stick."

He hands me a perfectly whittled roasting stick, and our fingers brush. It's such a small thing, but I'm suddenly hyperaware of his proximity. The way he smells like woodsmoke and summer. The occasional bump of his shoulder against mine.

Sparky is telling a story about a prank gone wrong. Everyone's laughing, but I'm more focused on Jamie—the way he throws his head back when he genuinely finds something funny, how different that laugh is from his usual troublemaker chuckle.

A young camper comes over looking upset. His marshmallow fell in the fire.

"Hey, buddy," Jamie says, his demeanor shifting to something gentler. "That's the worst, right? Here, take mine. I haven't started roasting it yet."

"Really?"

"Yeah, really. But you gotta promise to get it perfectly golden brown."

The kid grins and runs back with Jamie's marshmallow. Sparky gives Jamie grief about going soft, but Jamie just shrugs.

I've never noticed how kind Jamie is with younger campers. It's not the behavior of someone just causing trouble for attention. It's someone who understands what it feels like to be overlooked.

"You okay?" Jamie asks quietly, noticing my attention.

"Yeah. Just thinking."

"Dangerous activity."

"Says the person who clearly thinks too much."

He grins. "Touché."

Someone starts playing "Blue Moon" on guitar, campers singing along. I think about how this is one of my last nights at Camp Silver Lake. How summer is almost over.

"What are you going to do when camp ends?" I ask Jamie. "Do you go home?"

His expression clouds slightly. "Back to my dad's place, I guess. For a week or two. Then probably my mom's. They'll shuffle me back and forth until school starts, both of them annoyed that they have to deal with me."

"Jamie—"

"It's fine. I'm used to it." But his voice suggests it's not fine at all.

"What about school?"

"Depends on whether I get expelled again or not." He says it like a joke, but there's an edge underneath. "My dad's threatening military school if I can't 'shape up.'"

"Would you want to go?"

"Hell no." He picks up a stick and pokes at the fire. "But what I want doesn't really factor into their decisions."

We sit in silence for a moment. The campfire song continues, but we're in our own quiet bubble.

"This summer has been different, though," Jamie says finally. "It's made me think about... what matters. And who matters." He glances at me. "About whether I want to keep being the person everyone expects me to be, or if I can be someone else."

"You're not a bad person, Jamie."

"Maybe not. But I've spent a long time acting like I don't care about anything because it's easier than admitting I care and getting hurt." He's still watching the fire. "This summer made me realize that maybe caring is worth the risk."

My heart is beating too fast. "What changed?"

He turns to look at me, firelight catching in his eyes. "You did."

Before I can process that, Sparky comes over in a panic.

"Jamie, we have a problem. That prank? Tommy accidentally triggered it early. We need to fix it before Morrison finds out."

Jamie sighs, looking torn. "I have to go deal with this."

"It's okay. Go."

He stands, then hesitates. His hand comes to rest on my shoulder, warm and solid, and he squeezes gently. It's brief, maybe three seconds, but deliberate. His thumb brushes against my collarbone before he pulls away.

"Save my spot?" he asks.

I nod, not trusting my voice.

He leaves with Sparky, and I sit there with my shoulder still tingling from his touch, my thoughts spinning.

Betty appears almost immediately, sliding into Jamie's vacated spot.

"Okay, so you sat with him," she says.

"I sat with a friend."

"Please. I've been watching you all night. You haven't looked at the fire once. You've been looking at him."

"Betty—"

"And that shoulder touch? That wasn't a friend touch."

"You're reading too much into it."

"Am I?" She gives me a knowing look. "When are you going to admit that you like him? Really like him?"

I open my mouth to deny it, but the words stick.

Because she's right.

Somewhere between Jamie's constant presence and his honest conversations and his way of seeing me—really seeing me—I've stopped thinking about Michael. I've stopped fantasizing about someone unattainable and started noticing someone real.

"I think I might," I whisper.

Betty's grin is triumphant. "Finally!"

"But what if I'm wrong? What if I'm just doing the same thing I did with Michael—building something in my head that isn't real?"

"It's different this time. Michael never saw you. Jamie can't stop seeing you." She bumps my shoulder. "Just pay attention at the talent show. I think things are going to get interesting."

That's what everyone keeps saying. And as I sit here, my shoulder still warm from Jamie's touch, I'm starting to believe them.

Something is going to happen at the talent show. Something that will change everything.

And for the first time all summer, I'm not afraid of what that change might bring.

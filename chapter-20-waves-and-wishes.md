# Chapter 20: Shifting Focus

The day before the talent show, I wake up with a strange realization.

I'm not thinking about Michael.

I lie in my bunk while the other girls get ready for breakfast, and I try to remember the last time Michael was my first thought. It used to be every morning—wondering if I'd see him at activities, whether today would be the day he'd notice me.

But this morning, I'm wondering if Jamie slept well. If he's still nervous about his performance. If he'll sit with me at breakfast.

The shift is so complete it unsettles me.

"You coming?" Betty asks, already dressed and heading toward the door with the other girls.

"Yeah. Be right there."

I get dressed quickly and head to the mess hall. The morning is perfect—cool and clear, with that end-of-summer feeling. Tomorrow is the talent show. The summer that felt endless is suddenly racing toward its conclusion.

At breakfast, I catch myself scanning the tables for Jamie before I even look for Michael. When I spot him sitting with Sparky, my chest does a little flip.

Betty notices, of course. "You're looking for him," she says, sitting beside me.

"I'm looking for a place to sit."

"Uh-huh. And the fact that you're staring at Jamie's table is a complete coincidence."

I don't have a good answer, so I just start eating.

Michael and Dorothy come in together, laughing about something. They get their food and sit at the counselors' table. Michael catches my eye and waves, friendly and warm, the same way he waves at every camper who helped with the show.

I wave back.

And I feel... nothing. No butterflies, no racing heart, no desperate hope that he'll come over to talk to me. Just a mild fondness for someone who's been kind and patient while teaching me lighting cues.

"You're really over him," Betty observes.

"I think I am."

"Because of Jamie?"

I take a bite of toast, considering the question. "Maybe. Or maybe I just finally saw what was real instead of what I wanted to see."

Betty grins. "Either way, I'm calling it personal growth."

---

The final dress rehearsal happens after lunch. Everyone's nervous, energy crackling through the mess hall. Performers practice last-minute details. Michael runs through the order of acts one more time.

I'm at my lighting board, calm and ready. I know every cue by heart.

Michael comes over during a break. "Lily, I just want to say thank you. You've been amazing these past three weeks. I couldn't have done this without you."

The compliment is nice. It feels good to be appreciated.

But my heart doesn't race. I don't read secret meaning into his words.

It's just a compliment. From a counselor to a camper who helped out.

"Thanks, Michael. It's been fun learning all this."

"You're a natural. If you ever want to do theater tech in school, you'd be great at it." He pats my shoulder—the same friendly pat he gives everyone—and moves on to talk to the Benson twins about their harmony.

I watch him go, and there's no ache, no longing. Just a quiet acknowledgment that he was never going to be my person.

During the rehearsal, I watch Michael and Dorothy work together. They're holding hands now, not hiding it anymore. They're sweet together—compatible and easy, clearly in love.

And I feel happy for them. Just genuine happiness.

The heartbreak I expected never comes. Maybe because you can't lose something you never had.

After rehearsal, I'm gathering my notes when Jamie appears at my elbow.

"Hey. Can you come with me for a minute?"

There's something in his voice—nervousness, anticipation, maybe fear—that makes me agree immediately.

"Sure. Where are we going?"

"You'll see."

He leads me to the lake. The sun is setting, painting the sky in shades of pink and orange.

We end up at the dock. Our dock, the place where we had that first real conversation.

Jamie sits on the edge, feet dangling over the water. I sit beside him, close enough that our shoulders almost touch.

For a long moment, we just watch the sunset.

"I'm terrified," Jamie says finally.

"Of what?"

"Tomorrow. The talent show. My performance." He picks up a small stone and tosses it into the water. "I've never cared about something this much before. Never put myself out there like this."

"It's going to be great. Everyone's been saying you've been working so hard on it."

"That's not what I'm afraid of." He turns to look at me, and the vulnerability in his expression makes my breath catch. "I'm not afraid it'll be bad. I'm afraid you won't understand what I'm trying to say. Or that you'll understand and it won't—" He stops, struggling for words. "It won't matter to you the way it matters to me."

My heart is pounding now. "Jamie, what is your performance about?"

"You." He says it simply, quietly, like it's both the easiest and hardest thing he's ever admitted. "It's about you, Lily. The whole thing. Everything I've been working on all summer. I made it for you."

The words settle into my chest, heavy and warm.

"Why?" I whisper.

"Because you inspired me." He's still looking at me, and I can see how much this costs him. "For the first time in years, you made me want to create something instead of destroy things. You made me want to be better, to matter."

"Jamie, you already are—"

"No, let me finish. Please." He takes a shaky breath. "I've spent so long being the troublemaker, the kid nobody wants. But you saw past all that. You saw me, the real me, and you didn't run away. You stayed."

He turns back to the lake.

"You made me realize that hiding behind pranks is just as much a fantasy as your Michael crush. We were both hiding. And I want to stop hiding. I want to be real with you."

"You have shown me," I say quietly. "In all our conversations, in the way you listen, in the book of stories you made. I already see you, Jamie."

"I know. That's what scares me." He laughs, but it sounds nervous. "Because if you see all of me and decide it's not enough, that's real rejection. That's not just a fantasy crush not working out. That's actually being known and not being wanted."

I understand completely. It's exactly what I've been afraid of all summer.

"What if I told you I'm scared of the same thing?" I ask.

He looks at me, surprised.

"You see me too," I continue. "You see past the quiet girl hiding in books. You know about my parents and my fears. And you're still here. That's terrifying."

"Terrifying how?"

"Terrifying because it means you matter. What you think of me actually matters, and that means you could hurt me in ways Michael never could, because Michael never knew me at all."

Jamie is very still, watching me carefully.

"Are you saying—" He stops, like he's afraid to finish the question.

"I'm saying I don't look for Michael anymore when I walk into a room. I look for you." The confession spills out before I can stop it. "I'm saying your touch on my shoulder last night meant more than every compliment Michael has ever given me. I'm saying that somewhere between your annoying cannonballs and your honest conversations and your book of stories, you became the person I think about when I wake up."

His eyes widen. "Lily—"

"I'm falling for you, Jamie Sullivan. And it's completely terrifying because it's real. You're real. This is real. And real things can actually hurt me."

For a moment, neither of us moves. The sky deepens to purple.

Then Jamie reaches for my hand. His fingers intertwine with mine, warm and solid and right.

"I'm falling for you too," he says. "Have been, probably since you yelled at me for soaking your Jane Austen."

"I didn't yell."

"You kind of did. It was great. I just thought—there's a real person under all that quiet. And I wanted to know everything about her."

I'm smiling. Actually smiling, the kind that comes from deep in my chest.

"So tomorrow," Jamie says. "At the talent show. When I perform. I'm going to show you everything I've been working on. And it's going to be obvious—to you, to everyone—what it means. Who it's for."

"I'll be there."

"I know." He squeezes my hand. "That's the only reason I can do it."

We sit there as the sun finishes setting, hands linked, shoulders touching. The dinner bell rings in the distance, but neither of us moves.

"Hey, Lily?"

"Yeah?"

"Whatever happens tomorrow—I want you to know that this summer mattered. You mattered. You changed me."

"You changed me too."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. You made me brave enough to stop hiding."

He grins, that real grin that transforms his whole face. "We make a good pair of recovering hiders."

"The best."

Eventually, we have to head back. But we walk slowly, hands still linked.

Tomorrow is the talent show. Tomorrow, whatever Jamie has been working on will be revealed. Tomorrow, everything might change.

But tonight, walking back from the dock with Jamie's hand in mine, I'm not afraid of the change.

Because for the first time all summer, I'm choosing reality over fantasy.

And reality—messy and scary and uncertain as it is—is so much better than any safe crush could ever be.

---

Later, lying in my bunk after lights out, I replay the conversation. Jamie's vulnerability. His confession. The way his hand felt in mine.

I think about Michael and Dorothy, happy and in love. I don't want what they have. I want what Jamie and I are building—honest and hard-earned and absolutely real.

Betty's in the bunk below me.

"Betty?" I whisper.

"Yeah?"

"I'm falling for Jamie."

"I know." I can hear the smile in her voice. "It's about time."

"What if tomorrow's a disaster?"

"Then you'll still be falling for him, and he'll still be falling for you. That part doesn't change."

She's right. Whatever Jamie performs tomorrow, it won't change how I feel. It won't change that he sees me, knows me, chose me.

I fall asleep with a smile on my face, thinking about a boy who taught me that being seen is better than being safe.

And tomorrow, I'll show him that I see him too.

# Chapter 20: Shifting Focus

I wake before the breakfast bell, my mind already racing. Today is the talent show. Today I'll see what Jamie created. Today everything changes.

I'm not ready. But I don't think I have a choice.

Betty is already awake, brushing her hair at the small mirror. When she sees me sitting up, she grins.

"Big day!"

"You're performing. I'm just running lights."

"Sure. That's all that's happening today." Her knowing smile makes me want to hide under my blanket.

At breakfast, I find myself scanning the mess hall for Jamie before I even think to look for Michael. When I spot Jamie at a corner table with Sparky, my heart does this stupid flutter thing.

He catches my eye and waves. Just a simple wave, but it makes me smile.

Across the room, Michael is going over the program with Dorothy, both of them focused and professional. I watch them for a moment—he's handsome and kind and everything I thought I wanted. But my heart doesn't race. My stomach doesn't flip.

Michael Grant has become just a nice person I know. Nothing more.

How did that happen?

---

The day crawls by. Final rehearsal in the morning, then free time before the show tonight. I'm too nervous to read, too restless to sit still. I end up at our spot by the rocks, hoping Jamie won't be there because I need to think.

Of course he's there.

He's skipping stones with fierce concentration, like he's trying to set a world record. When I sit on my rock, he acknowledges me with a nod but keeps throwing.

We sit in silence for maybe ten minutes. Then:

"Are you scared?" I ask.

"Terrified."

"Of performing?"

"Of what comes after." He finally looks at me. "Of showing you something real and having you... I don't know. Not understand it. Not feel the same way."

My breath catches. "The same way about what?"

He doesn't answer. Just goes back to skipping stones.

I watch him—the way the afternoon sun catches in his dark hair, the concentration on his face, the nervous energy in his movements. Jamie Sullivan, who I once thought was just an annoying troublemaker. Who became my friend. Who became...

Something more. When did he become something more?

"I thought about Michael all morning," I say quietly.

Jamie's shoulders tense, but he doesn't turn around.

"And?"

"And I realized I had to actively make myself think about him. He didn't just pop into my head like he used to. Like he did constantly that first week." I pick up a stone, turning it over in my hands. "You know who I thought about first thing when I woke up this morning?"

"Who?"

"You. Wondering what your act is. Whether you're nervous. What it means that you made it for me."

Now he turns, eyes searching my face. "And what do you think it means?"

"I don't know. But I think... I think I want to find out."

Something shifts in his expression—hope, maybe, or relief. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

He sits beside me on my rock, close enough that our shoulders touch. The contact sends electricity through me.

"Can I tell you something?" he asks.

"Anything."

"That first day, when I cannonballed off the dock and ruined your book? I saw you sitting there reading, completely absorbed, and I thought you were the most interesting person I'd seen all summer. So I manufactured a reason to talk to you."

"You ruined a first edition Jane Eyre to talk to me?"

"I didn't know it was first edition! I just saw a quiet girl with a book and thought 'I want to know her.' So I did what I always do—caused chaos and hoped for the best."

I'm stunned. "All this time, I thought you were just being careless."

"I'm never careless. Reckless, yes. Intentional, always." He bumps my shoulder. "Every time I 'accidentally' showed up where you were? Every prank I pulled during Michael's activities? Every conversation where I pushed you to see reality instead of fantasy? All intentional."

"Why?"

"Because you made me want to be real instead of performative. Because you saw through my act and called me on it. Because talking to you felt like the first honest thing I'd done in years." He takes a shaky breath. "Because I started falling for you somewhere around the second week, and I've been falling ever since."

The world stops.

Everything stops.

Jamie Sullivan is telling me he's falling for me.

"I—" My voice doesn't work.

"You don't have to say anything," he says quickly. "I know this is a lot. I know you just got over Michael, or think you are. I know we're friends and this might ruin it. But I had to tell you before tonight. Before you see what I made. So you'd understand what it means."

"What does it mean?"

"It means you're the most important person in my life. It means I want to be brave enough to show you the real me, not the mask I show everyone else. It means—" He stops, looking vulnerable in a way I've never seen. "It means I hope you might feel the same way. Eventually. Even if not right now."

I should say something. Should tell him I don't know what I feel, that this is all so new, that I need time.

Instead, I find myself saying: "I look for you first now. At breakfast, at activities, everywhere. I think about what you'd say about things. I miss you when you're not around. And when you touch me—even just your hand on my shoulder—I feel it everywhere."

"Lily—"

"I'm falling too," I whisper. "I don't know when it started. Maybe that day at the rocks when you showed me your drawings. Maybe during the scavenger hunt. Maybe—" I laugh shakily. "Maybe the first day, when you ruined my book and I was furious and you grinned like it was the best thing you'd ever done."

He stares at me like I've said something impossible.

"You're falling for me?"

"I think I am. I think I have been for a while. I just didn't want to admit it because it was real and Michael was safe and I'm terrified of real things."

"Me too," he admits. "Real things can actually hurt."

"Yeah."

We sit there, shoulders touching, the truth hanging between us like something fragile and precious.

"So what now?" I ask.

"Now... we see what happens. We watch the show tonight. You see what I made for you. And then... I don't know. We figure it out together?"

"Together."

"Yeah. Together." He grins, and it's the real smile, the one that transforms his whole face. "Is this the part where we have to talk about feelings and what we are and all that stuff?"

"Probably."

"Can we skip it and just... be whatever we are? See where it goes?"

"Yes. Please."

He laughs, and the sound is pure relief. "Thank God. I'm terrible at defining relationships."

"Me too."

We sit in comfortable silence, and I realize—this is what I've been missing all summer. Not Michael's professional kindness or his handsome smile. This. Sitting with someone who sees me completely and wants to be seen in return. Someone who makes me want to be brave instead of safe.

Someone who feels like home.

The dinner bell rings from camp, calling us back. Jamie stands and offers me his hand.

"Ready for tonight?"

"No. But I'll do it anyway."

"That's my girl." He freezes. "I mean—sorry, that's presumptuous, I didn't—"

"I like it." And I do. The idea of being Jamie's girl instead of invisible Lily Palmer. The idea of belonging to someone who actually knows me.

We walk back to camp hand in hand, and I don't let go until we have to split toward our separate cabins.

In my bunk, I lie staring at the ceiling, my hand still warm from his touch.

Tonight I'll see what Jamie created for me. Tonight the whole camp will see his real self instead of his mask.

And tonight I'll have to be brave enough to let him see how I really feel.

The thought terrifies me.

But for the first time in my life, I'm running toward something real instead of hiding behind fantasy.

Even if it scares me.

Especially because it scares me.

Because Jamie was right all along—real things can hurt. But they're also the only things worth having.

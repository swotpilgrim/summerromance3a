Purpose: Bring Lily's Michael fantasy to its crushing conclusion while revealing Jamie's sincere feelings.

Beats:

    Talent show night. The mess hall is transformed. Lily takes her position at the lighting board, nervous but focused on her cues.

    The show proceeds well. Betty's cabin sketch gets huge laughs. Sparky’s magic fails charmingly. Lily is aware Jamie's performance is coming.

    Jamie takes the stage, visibly nervous and without props. He recites a beautiful, vulnerable poem he wrote about being seen and finding connection. The words are clearly about Lily.

    The audience erupts in applause. Lily's hands shake, realizing he made that for her.

    After the show, Michael thanks everyone. He calls Dorothy up, puts his arm around her, and thanks his "wonderful girlfriend" in front of the camp.

    The camp applauds, clearly unsurprised. Lily realizes everyone knew. Humiliated, she flees the mess hall, ignoring Betty calling her name.

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words  
**POV:** Lily Palmer, first person  
**Setting:** Lake dock, nighttime  
**Time:** Immediately after talent show

Purpose: Allow Lily to process the destruction of her fantasy and understand what she was hiding from.

Beats:

    Lily runs blindly to the lake, collapsing at the end of the dark dock. She finally lets herself cry, big, gasping sobs held back all summer.

    She knows the tears aren't just for Michael. She's crying for the weeks spent chasing a fantasy and for the burning humiliation that everyone else saw the truth.

    Beneath the hurt is a strange relief. She realizes she was in love with an idea. The crush was safe; an unattainable boy could never really reject her.

    She cries harder, realizing she was hiding. Jamie offered a real, scary connection, and she ignored it for her safe fantasy.

    Her tears finally slow, leaving her empty, raw, but lighter. The fantasy is cut away. She hears footsteps on the dock and knows it's Jamie.

Dialogue Topics: This chapter is all internal monologue. Self-recrimination about her obliviousness. Recognition of why the fantasy (Michael) felt safe and reality (Jamie) felt dangerous.

Emotional Arc: Lily begins in crisis, overwhelmed and sobbing. She moves through layers of hurt (humiliation, self-anger) to a painful clarity: her crush was protection, and she was hiding.

Key Details: Nighttime lake; stars reflected on water; distant mess hall sounds; ugly, gasping sobs; the dock as her refuge; the realization of "safety vs. reality"; footsteps announcing Jamie's arrival.

**POV:** Lily Palmer, first person  
**Setting:** Lake dock, nighttime  
**Time:** Continuing immediately after Chapter 22

Purpose: Show Jamie's genuine care as he comforts Lily, deepening their connection through his patient presence.

Beats:

    Jamie sits beside Lily without speaking. He doesn't ask if she's okay, doesn't say "I told you so," doesn't try to fix anything. He just sits, a steady, patient presence.

    Grateful for the silence, Lily eventually apologizes for running out. Jamie says heartbreak doesn't follow a schedule, and his understanding almost makes her cry again.

    She admits she feels stupid for not seeing Michael and Dorothy. Jamie reframes it: she wasn't stupid, she was protecting herself by building a fantasy.

    They sit in silence. Lily tells him his poem was beautiful. Jamie admits he's been working on it all summer, inspired by her to create something meaningful.

    Lily asks why her. Jamie confesses she's the first person who made him want to be seen—his real self, not the troublemaker act.

**Time:** Continuing immediately after Chapter 23

Purpose: Reveal Jamie's summer-long creative project, making his deep feelings tangible and showing her how he values her.

Beats:

    Jamie pulls a hand-bound leather book from his jacket. He confesses this was his real talent show act, but he lost his nerve; the poem was his backup.

    He hands it to Lily. Inside are short stories, handwritten and illustrated with his sketches. The craftsmanship shows weeks of work.

    The stories are about them. A girl who lives in books, a boy who causes trouble. Each story shows them finding each other in different ways.

    Some are funny (the scavenger hunt), others tender (their first dock talk). The final story is unfinished, with a note: "Happy ending pending."

    Lily cries again, this time from overwhelming emotion. No one has ever seen her so completely. She asks when he started. He says it was after their first dock conversation.

Dialogue Topics: Jamie's confession about losing his nerve. His explanation that this was his real act. Lily's questions about when he started. Jamie's answer: after their first vulnerable talk.

Emotional Arc: Lily moves from curiosity about the book to overwhelming emotion as she realizes the depth of Jamie's creative dedication. This is the moment she understands his feelings are real.

**Setting:** Lake dock, nighttime  
**Time:** Continuing immediately after Chapter 24

Purpose: Crystallize Lily's realization that Jamie is who she wants, completing her arc from hiding to vulnerability.

Beats:

    Lily holds the book. Jamie explains he started writing after she told him about her parents. He saw his own hiding in her, and the stories grew from there.

    He confesses he's been falling for her since she got mad about her soaked Jane Eyre—her fire and backbone captivated him.

    Lily replays the summer: Jamie's teasing was attention, his appearances were intentional. She was chasing a fantasy while he was right there.

    She calls herself an idiot. Jamie corrects her: she was scared. Michael was safe (impossible), while Jamie was terrifying (real and present).

    Lily asks if it's too late. Jamie says no, they have a week, and live only three hours apart. He takes her hand, and it feels natural.

Dialogue Topics: Jamie's confession (falling for her since Jane Eyre). Lily's self-recrimination ("I've been an idiot"). Jamie's reframing ("You were scared"). Lily's "Is it too late?" Jamie's reassurance.

Purpose: Deepen their emotional intimacy through extended vulnerable conversation, establishing their relationship's foundation.

Beats:

    They stay on the dock talking for hours, hands intertwined. Jamie admits he was terrified she'd choose someone else, and watching her chase Michael was painful.

    He says he tried to warn her, not to be cruel, but because he saw everything about her and wanted her to notice him.

    Lily confesses she was noticing him but was afraid. Jamie was real and therefore risky; Michael was a safe, impossible fantasy.

    She admits being visible is terrifying. Jamie says she matters to him, and she made him want to stop hiding, too.

    They share future dreams (his art, her teaching) and fears about their broken families. Lily realizes this is what real connection feels like.

Dialogue Topics: Jamie’s fear of losing her. Lily’s confession (Michael = safe, Jamie = risky). Their mutual fears of being seen. Shared family pain. Dreams for the future (art, teaching).

    He bluntly tells her Michael doesn't see her that way and treats her like a kid sister. He says he's being honest because he cares and it's painful to watch.

    Lily deflects, asking why he cares. Jamie, frustrated, says it's because they're friends, and friends don't let friends waste their summer on a fantasy.

    On the path, Lily explodes, accusing Jamie of being miserable. She cruelly says his parents don't want him.
